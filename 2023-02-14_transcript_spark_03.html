So, um, what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll project that out and then we can go through like scenarios, like if things changed or whatever. So that&#39;s really important for the budget. Um, and then looking at like what, you know, the labor costs and things like that for that. Um, and then um, you know, just the cash flow changes, Um, and I think that&#39;s everything. So I&#39;m, you know, just going to make those few adjustments that we just talked about and I&#39;ll share that with you. Um, I&#39;m going to share the open invoice detail as of today, but it really is as of, um, like the ninth in the, in the master, um, communication sheet that I have from, uh, Google.</p><p><strong>SM inquires about LG parking customers money in RBC account (later found to be wanted to inflate numbers for mortgage company to see)</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And then I think there was one other thing that I had sent you guys that was like a Loom video of, um, I think it was a, uh, you a big, big invoice that you guys had. And you did. There was a prepayment for a deposit for a client that was received at the end of 2022.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Goose Island?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So we marked it as like a contra income item on a new invoice and it makes the revenue for this current period, I think it was January, um, looks super low because instead of having like a reduced receivable or revenue item, you subtracted like what was received in a different period. And so that was like a video that I had sent you to try to explain the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Oh, I didn&#39;t even I didn&#39;t even see that. I think I know what you&#39;re talking about. I think it&#39;s the the Goose Island one. It was like $28,000?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />It is Goose Island. Yeah.</p><p><strong>LG says Goose Island does this quite regularly, meaning we most likely pay sales tax on the money since qbo goes thru so many different accountants hands</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. Okay. So how should that be done? And I guess so that scenario is very specific to they do it pretty regularly at the end of the year.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They&#39;re just trying to basically clear out budget from their, you know, their budget and they just want to park it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Theydon&#39;t even know... they just literally tell me we have $28,000, can you make an invoice for whatever, and so we make it, they transfer it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And then when it becomes, you know, it could be 50 million hats for $28,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Ndthen in reality, they come back and say, we just need 100 shirts.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And they&#39;re kind of just using that as credit to like break off to other things. Okay.</p><p><strong>look into this. rexport sales tax reports now that all printavo orders have been zeroed out at line item level and all discounts used by LG that unknowingly effected the reporting as Stephanie states here.
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um. So it would be essentially like a deposit on, um, you know, an invoice. So it&#39;s, it should be like a partial payment, Um, and depending on, you know, like sales tax and your and how your revenue is reported.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Ou know, if that&#39;s not fully closed, then it&#39;s not like a realized revenue item because you don&#39;t want to take like they&#39;re paying stuff so they don&#39;t have a tax burden, but you don&#39;t want to just receive money and be a be a tax burden for them either.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, so it&#39;s kind of something I just, I want to kind of like look at. Um, and also I just wanted to know like the situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So if, if they&#39;re like, kind of prepaying or depositing or like, you know, giving you money up front end of year, it happens all the time with tons of vendors and stuff like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So just to kind of understand like the nothing was in production, like people weren&#39;t working on things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You weren&#39;t... there was like no cost associated with that money received at the end of the year. And everything that&#39;s going to happen is going to happen in 2023, right? </p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>not sure what to do, yet consults no one
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Correct. Right. So they so the only is it so... so if you&#39;re in Printavo, it&#39;s the first one was the 700775. That was kind of the dummy invoice that was made.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That was the $28,279 and then the what became the real production was the 700939. And that&#39;s probably where you saw it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, so like all the way at the footer of that, like in the fees, I just have credit from the 700775 applied which was that $28,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So I mean if that&#39;s the wrong way to do it then then that&#39;s fine, we can do it however, I just didn&#39;t know how to like show it as something and not have the original one.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The700775 still showing as a balance. So I just zeroed that out basically like discounted it 100% just so it&#39;s not showing in our AR. Now there&#39;s two that are due currently.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I know, I kind of thought so, but I needed to just have confirmation with you because it it&#39;s two different implications.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Like when you were working on it, you know? You know what I mean? So I just wanted to make sure that, you know, it wasn&#39;t like a redo or like, you know what I mean? Like something I just wanted to confirm that what I thought was happening is what&#39;s happening. And then I&#39;m just going to look at it closer and, um, I will circle back with that. And I want to make sure that you got that video. You don&#39;t have to. Basically what I&#39;m telling you is what is on the video so you don&#39;t have to watch it again.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. No, no. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Make sure you know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Where is this I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Where is this video you&#39;re talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I emailed like a loom video of that, um, Goose Island invoice.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But like, months ago or like, recently?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, it would have been probably, like a couple of weeks ago.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I feel like I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t see it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t see it either.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You guys are super responsive. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m surprised that you didn&#39;t, um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You weren&#39;t so excited about my videos.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah, I went through all my emails. I don&#39;t see it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />That&#39;s weird. Okay, so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The last one that I see is just from, it looks like November 2nd of 22.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, if I just search loom, but I don&#39;t see anything else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Oh. Okay. I was like, Damn, I&#39;ve emailed you. So okay, so I&#39;ll go through, um, and see why that didn&#39;t make it over the fence.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Because I was kind of thinking that, so I&#39;m glad I checked it on that. Um, and I&#39;ll resend it, so in case you want to see it, but we kind of covered it here. And then, um, now that I confirmed that what I thought is true, I will kind of walk through what, what a best practice would be for, you know, like a tax implication and like being, having like the best metrics and like the best reporting.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />AndI know it seems like I&#39;m getting like really into the details and stuff here, but but this type of stuff is important because I don&#39;t want you to have like an overstated revenue in the previous period and then it&#39;s going to overstate your costs and understate your revenue when you&#39;re actually working on the product and this and that. So I&#39;m just going to kind of show you that. But don&#39;t worry too, too much about it because I catch these things and that&#39;s what I do. So.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>says not technically "laundering"
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. Um, no, I mean, knowing that is good.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Imean, I think because it&#39;s not like that&#39;s an ongoing thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But now knowing that, I think if it comes up, I&#39;ll just make sure that you&#39;re at least in the loop and saying, hey, here&#39;s... even before we do anything to say, here&#39;s what they&#39;re asking. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Like, is this something that we want to do? I think my mentality at the end of the year is just, okay, sure, if you want to float some money in there, then then great, we&#39;re floating some money.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But um, the only so another situation that we or a conversations that I&#39;ve had with them is they have sometimes they&#39;re not able to specifically sponsor or to pay specific vendors for something.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Solet&#39;s say that they&#39;re going to pay whatever $5,000 to us and they want to pay $4,000 to sponsor something else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They can&#39;t specifically hand over that money to that client.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So it&#39;s not like we&#39;re we&#39;re not laundering it, but like it transactionally, they&#39;re trying to put it through us to be able to pay those vendors. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />that like, how would that scenario ever or is that just something we just talk through when it because every time they brought it up, I&#39;m confused and I&#39;m like, sure, whatever. We&#39;ll just talk about it when it happens and figure out what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Has it happened before? How have you guys done it for them?</p><p><strong>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gjhL-jPJnWeCiuc10jHq6oKgnQ6L-5uw&usp=drive_fs
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Um, yeah. So basically it&#39;s it&#39;s like a pass through moment where you would have like an item on your invoice to them that&#39;s essentially like zero markup, like because or, you know, zero margin because you&#39;re going to invoice them for something and then you&#39;re going to turn around and give it all to somebody else and you&#39;re not going to make like a profit on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And so if you&#39;re like, if you&#39;re truly like, job costing and we&#39;re like doing real like project reporting and stuff like that, we would see that, you know, the hats or whatever for this company.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You know, you had a 35% markup margin on it and then, you know, your service was price of this and you made this and that on this project. But then when it comes to that line item, there was no profit on it because you shouldn&#39;t profit on hat part of it, you know what I mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So it was just a pass through moment where they needed you to receive the money and then pay it out to the like promoter person or the, you know, donation, the charitable contribution that it gets.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>very interested in a hypothetical
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, yeah. I mean, do I think I&#39;m, I&#39;m thinking even like, so in that last transaction then it what do we have to do? Like are we then 1099 that person because technically, you know, let&#39;s say just for easy numbers, it&#39;s $5,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They want to do $4,500 worth of hats that were then going to give to that thing. And they also want to donate $500 to that organization if it&#39;s all coming through us.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And ultimately, if we&#39;re handing over a check for a payment, then what? Like, what does that even look like? And is that over complicating and opening us up for like, are they just circumventing all the other tax stuff to deal with?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I was kind of wondering what their reason was that they like, why can&#39;t you pay a charity? But um, you like, what did they do? But, um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s because. It&#39;s because they can&#39;t. They specifically, like, they&#39;re not allowed to, I think, because of their distribution or how they&#39;re a distributor.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They can&#39;t legally, like Goose Island couldn&#39;t just say, Hey, we&#39;re giving this bar, you know, $10,000 because it&#39;s not. It&#39;s whatever. However it works in that world, they&#39;re not allowed to do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea. Because of those laws.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So, um, you would 1099 like, um,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Whoever it&#39;s going to?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Exactly. And that would be your pass through, like, so you received X amount of money and then you paid X amount of people for this and it all comes out in your tax return too.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Solike you would see, um, and whether or not they&#39;re 1099 eligible or not, like if are, um, you know, exempt for whichever reason, what the input and the output like what&#39;s offset um, is your, is your net revenue.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So because it&#39;s a pass through because you have 5000 in and then you have 5000 out on the total project for Goose Island like that will net to zero. So you&#39;re not making money.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So on your tax return, you&#39;ve reported 5000 in and then you&#39;ve reported 5000 out because you&#39;ve paid a charity donation foundation and that net zero.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And so your business who has a tax return and so whether or not their 1099 eligible I love that you&#39;re thinking about 1099s and all that. So maybe we will. Maybe we won&#39;t. It depends on their entity status. But at the end of the day, your tax return will show that net wash where it&#39;s zero because you received and then you gave it away.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. All right. Yeah. I mean, I think we just want it when or if it comes up, then we&#39;ll just talk through it too. But I&#39;ve always been confused with that situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I would love to talk through that and just make sure that it&#39;s like on the level and that there&#39;s nothing being missed, but it should be just a pass through.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. All right. So yeah, I think that&#39;s the only other ones that, um, yeah, I think so.</p><p><strong>same situation cash stashing scam this with LG wifes Employer Constellation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Constellation has their fiscal year ending too, before the end of this month and so they&#39;re kind of a similar so it wouldn&#39;t happen outside because their fiscal year is not normal.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So if they want to do the same thing, is that something that I just bring up to you? Like if we have a rep who literally says I have $2,500 that is left here, like we just want to park that money with you guys, we just say, That&#39;s fine, pay us and we&#39;ll just credit it. And then because we&#39;d still be doing that work within our 2022 or 2023, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, exactly. And what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll show because I don&#39;t have anything wrong with that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I just want to make sure it&#39;s all like recorded correctly.
