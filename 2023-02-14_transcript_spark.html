Yeah, we get a little. We get a little hectic this time, so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What&#39;s like the norm just for all? Just like, filings or just regular prep work already?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, like the prep work and just kind of getting everything buttoned up and, like, liaising with all the different facets of things that need to kind of, you know, Voltron together for a good, a good return. So that&#39;s kind of the the norm these days.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />How many people how many people are you holding right now for like screen printing?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />How many how many screen printing clients do I have?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. Yeah. Or just like similar like decoration facilities or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />That&#39;s a good question. Off the top of my head, I&#39;m not positive. Between like ten and 20, I would say.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Really?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And the majority? Like, where&#39;s the majority?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Located?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, just like clientele wise, because you guys deal with restaurants, too, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I, um, I... because we have different divisions and different leads and things like that that handle the different divisions. So I specialize in screen printing and I don&#39;t work with restaurants anymore. So I used to, because I worked in restaurants, but I don&#39;t work in restaurants any longer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. A different calculated chaos?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yep, absolutely. But it&#39;s all kind of, you know, it&#39;s all a little bit similar in certain ways. You can kind of, you know, pass different nuances around and things like that. But yeah, I don&#39;t work directly with with restaurant anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, just curious. It&#39;s all sales at the end and money and money out at the end of the day.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Why did you see. So I have stopped. Um, I know that we are quite active on the social media and I. I&#39;m not a social media. I feel very old. I don&#39;t do anything with it anymore, so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re not a Tiktok influencer?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />My my work social media. I&#39;m. That&#39;ll be the last thing I ever look at. So people will be like what&#39;s going on with the blah blah, blah? And I&#39;m like, no idea.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>possible motive in chosing Spark?</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I just I remember looking like when we initially just kind of started talking with each other, I just remember seeing somewhere that like, it was restaurant stuff here and there as well. I mean, I knew about screen printing just from from Kansas and Ken and a couple other people. But just curious if like you guys had branched out to anything else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, there&#39;s a there&#39;s a big restaurant division. Um, I know I worked in it. I know of it, but screen printing is my my baby.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Awesome. All right, cool. Um, but yeah, so I guess just to jump in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So as far as the account, so we had a fraud situation with the bank. And so what we had to do was transfer everything to basically the old 4700 account, the other savings account. And I think there was one other checking account, right? There were three accounts. Um, they all</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The PPP account, 9710 account.</p><p><strong>LG states on 2023-02-09  in text that he only has a chase personal account
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tr1cMgdZA59uDaoBli-22isR-UunOJlb&usp=drive_fs

on 2023-02-14 LG says his Fifth third personal account is what made it set up so fast
Lucas did sign up for a new account 1 week before the account was closed</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea the PPP account. So those all closed as of last Friday, Thursday on the ninth. So that might have been when you saw those.

So basically what we&#39;ve been doing since since then is regrouping with Fifth Third to everything had to be shifted out of that in a cashier&#39;s check or multiple cashier&#39;s checks to be put into what is now the current, uh, the business one.

The only reason that I don&#39;t so I don&#39;t have a communal login to be able to share because the only, the quickest way that they could do it was to tie it to I have a personal account that that is there. So right now what I&#39;ve been trying to deal with them this morning is trying to get them to still separate that because we don&#39;t the fifth third direct is still not active like if you even go and I mean you can log into Fifth Third Direct but it still just has the last three accounts and everything is zeroed out on there as well.

So I&#39;ve been working with them to try to get not only Fifth Third Direct set back up so that we can send out wires, but also so that you can have access to that and so that the separation of both the personal and then the business one.

So the main focus for us was just to make sure that one, we could get that money out and into something because luckily payroll was last Tuesday. We have payroll coming up this Tuesday. So we just wanted to make sure that everything was shifted around as quickly as possible so that we could we could do that because as of now, mean today is the first somewhat functional day that we at least see the balance that was deposited in there as a pending balance.

We had to also reroute all of the credit card to be deposited into the new account too. And so that took some time. And so in the interim it was with card connect or card point, and now we had to jump to Stripe to be able to do that kind of very quickly.

So that&#39;s at least active as of right now. We saw the first deposit into the account from Stripe this morning and there was a couple others that people either processed yesterday and those are being deposited from what it says right now on Stripe on Friday. So it&#39;s just a little bit of a juggling act right now. But I think our main focus has just been, one, making sure that we&#39;re operable so that payroll can be made and then we&#39;ll continue to connect the rest of the dots.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. So yikes. That sounds like a stressful, stressful, frustrating time. And this isn&#39;t the first time this has happened, right? Isn&#39;t that happening?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Chase, was a...Chase was a different situation. They just... I don&#39;t... get a read on what...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That was Zelle.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, it was Zelle. It was a it was a transaction that we did with our customer that we&#39;ve been doing through Zelle for about three years. And they just flagged it for fraud and brought me in and said, &quot;Who is this?&quot; And I said, &quot;You tell me who this is, it&#39;s your customer.&quot; And then they said, &quot;What?&quot; And I had to call and the customer came out and he&#39;s like, &quot;we&#39;ve been doing business like this for years. And they&#39;re like, It&#39;s too late. The decision&#39;s been made. You&#39;re gone.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So painful. Do you know what? Do you know what happened this time, by any chance? Or is it like under investigation or anything?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>Lucas states "both of us have to be a signer on it."</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They won&#39;t give...so... like they&#39;re... I have a close relationship with the Charlotte Fifth Third and they they can&#39;t share anything. So the only reason that we were able to do it that quickly because being in Charlotte versus Joe in Chicago, we can&#39;t even open something that quickly without being in person. Like they won&#39;t do double, you know, like both of us have to be a signer on it. So it kind of was just a situation of let&#39;s just move this very quickly so that we can have something open and operable right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, how come we had to add Stripe? Why weren&#39;t you able to just switch bank accounts with what&#39;s going on with that? Because it&#39;s a personal account?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No. Any, any transfer like card point is the one who does the final processing of our credit cards. Any transfer of account takes seven business days, max, and they say there&#39;s no way to speed it up. So we had payments that we knew needed to be made and we already had a Stripe account. I was able to change..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />change it to the new account, and we were able to process right away. And we&#39;re already getting money into the new account already with Stripe, which is connected to Printavo.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So we&#39;re just waiting for Card Connect to reconnect because one, we have a better processing rate with card connect than we do Stripe. But with the seven days that it took or, you know, it&#39;s still literally in limbo with Card Connect. So at least Stripe, we were just trying to jump to something immediately so that at least the the clients who are paying through Printavo, you know, I mean at least that&#39;s in motion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Gotcha. Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The only other so I guess the only other caveat with that is that I mean, it doesn&#39;t really impact what&#39;s going on right now. It&#39;s just eventually we&#39;re going to have to move over the credit or the card processing with print because that&#39;s been its own whole thing that Printavo is doing to try to take I mean, if you you probably know some of that too. But um, so I mean, that&#39;ll be the next thing that we cross at that point. But even we need the information from Card Connect to be able to share our rates and the previous transactions with Printavo that they can at least match that rate versus whatever they have as kind of a general person so it&#39;s kind of a lot...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />They&#39;ll match your rate?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They so they&#39;ve been very kind of ambiguous with that. But every single time since they launched it, it&#39;s a huge like, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re... I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re part of, well, not social media wise, but if you&#39;re part of any of there&#39;s a Printavo of like support group and the world of Printavo has been completely kind of up in arms for the last,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Oh, totally yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You know, six months. So we&#39;ve been watching it. I mean, I went to a couple conferences where they were addressing it, and essentially that was everybody&#39;s kind of pain points of saying, well, I have better rates with whatever it is, and I get my payments the next day versus you holding them. And so Bruce and everybody has just been kind of ambiguously saying, if you have better rates than we&#39;re interested in talking with you about that to see like where those rates can go. So I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know where it is at this point anyway. And honestly card connect. I think any credit card processor has always been really, really difficult to get that information from... because our card connect, we had a mutual kind of client who introduced us to Card Connect, and so we&#39;re on like their family plan nonsense. But every time and this has happened for like years, we&#39;ve asked them what is our rate? And they&#39;re like, Oh, well, it&#39;s a sliding scale depending on, you know, what&#39;s coming in. And we&#39;re like, Well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />What?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What is that range? Yeah. So, so I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t even personally care if we stay with card connect whatsoever.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;d prefer just to know exactly what what we&#39;re on. I just think that card connect is the best out of everything because we know that at least we get everything the next day. But you know, 1 or 2 days isn&#39;t a killer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Um. All right, great. So I think I just to wrap my head around it, your... we have a personal account that&#39;s like a band aid right now, and that&#39;s where everything&#39;s coming in and out of?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, it&#39;s a business account. It&#39;s just the login is still associated with like, if if I log in, it has the business account and my personal account. So all I&#39;m waiting for them to do is to separate it. If I have to ultimately drop that personal account and just open a separate personal account to close that out, it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t really matter to me. So that&#39;s the only they just had to open it quickly. And I already had an account that was associated with that.

So instead of having to have two co-signers, they already knew me because of the relationship and they were able to kind of slide it through that way very quickly. I mean, it was up the next day, basically, but it&#39;s been on. It&#39;s a little weird cooling off period.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And I wonder because I have my own like accounting login, I don&#39;t log in through your login. Right? So I think that they can just add that that account to the account that I log into. Like you can just like tick a box and I should be able to, to have that added to the profile. Like to like the account that I see that.</p><p><strong>not sure of the logic. says all other banks require both signers, LG friends at 5/3 slide thru because they know him. its a business account that only he can see with his personal acct login, but when confronted  about it being  a checkbox for stephanie to get access, now LG says everything has been wiped out  and no one can see it. and he has to reassign rights to Stephanie (JZ never given access)</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah we can I just the only thing is because everything that was associated with a 4700 like all those old ones is literally like that got completely wiped away. So I can&#39;t even see, like until it&#39;s fully functional. Like even this morning when I was there, if I log in, I don&#39;t even have any of the old. information of like your you&#39;re not even no one&#39;s even on there to be able to say what you have visibility or access to. So the next step of that is just like we&#39;re going to have to like start the process basically, like assume that we just opened a new business business account. And so I have to reassign you all of the rights back to that. But those rights are also assigned within Fifth-third Direct, which isn&#39;t a alive right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay, okay. I&#39;m just trying to be as helpful as I can to try to expedite this so that we don&#39;t lose.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, for sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And have to be like, What was this? What was that? I don&#39;t see this. You know, I don&#39;t. I just don&#39;t want to have to do that. Like, um, you know, like scene reconstruction of, like, a bunch of days and like, as little time as possible that we have to, like, reconstruct because there is, like, missing account access or like integrations and things like that. That&#39;s just all I&#39;m trying to kind of like avoid with that. But I understand that these things take time and that, you know, it seems like you guys were really on top of it and, and did the absolute best that you can. So I&#39;m super impressed with how quickly we&#39;re able to triage that awful situation that you guys are in. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, no, I mean. That&#39;s the main thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />It&#39;s awesome.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>LG speaks with bank and never fills JZ in</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Be able to get everybody to so that you guys aren&#39;t losing days. So it&#39;s been my, my sleepless nights. So, um, hopefully I either have more information with them later today. Um, if not, then I mean, I anticipate it being solved hopefully this week. I don&#39;t the Fifth Third Direct element of it, I don&#39;t know because every single time I talk to any of them, They just ask who our Fifth Third Direct rep is. We never, we never had one. It just kind of was there and part of it, so I don&#39;t know on that element of it. But, you know, I think as far as I&#39;m concerned, if I can just make sure that even if we just all have a communal login right now that at least give you visibility to what&#39;s going on in there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Right. Right. And if we can, you know, like just connect QuickBooks and things like that and like just get that part.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s already connected. That&#39;s already all connected. We&#39;ve already approved the payments that they sent to the new account. So payroll is completely connected already with QuickBooks.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />That&#39;s awesome.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>never sent to JZ</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And there wouldn&#39;t have been sorry, there wouldn&#39;t have been any payments as of the ninth on that have been that came out of 4700 basically or and or the new the new account as of right now. So I mean I could even like as soon as there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s literally no activity basically it&#39;s just pending activity. So I can just even send you screenshots of what that even looks like right now until you know, you can have login. But there&#39;s, there&#39;s it&#39;s not like all of a sudden there&#39;s 4700 transactions back and forth we&#39;re trying to piece back together.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay, yeah, that would be great because I can see what I do see. So like in the bank feed center, what I see is that I do see that all the accounts, you know, went down to to zero. So I see that. But, and I see that in the like in the balance sheet. I can see like this like temp account that was, that was added like I could see that. But it&#39;s not like linked in the bank feed center, like information would be coming over live or, or like connecting or anything. And that&#39;s probably because, like you said, it&#39;s like it&#39;s an infant. It&#39;s like still, you know, becoming active. So, um, that&#39;s probably what that is. But yeah, if there&#39;s any information you can send over in the meantime, that would be great just to like, kind of not lose time. Yeah. With that, just to make sure we keep it, keep it active. Um, so that&#39;s great. I just want to, you know, make sure that we just keep everything on the, on the up and up with that. And I just wanted to make sure, um, you know, you guys weren&#39;t like, selling the business and running away to start an avocado farm or something I didn&#39;t know was happening. So is that like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Is that a good option? Avocados are a hot commodity.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I mean, if you&#39;re going to do that, just loop me in and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll join you. So just just keep me posted on stuff like that. Yeah. Um, yeah, I just didn&#39;t know it was happening. And, you know, knowing that, that&#39;s such a bummer. And so I&#39;m glad that you guys are sorting it out. And we&#39;ll, you know, I&#39;ll keep keep my eyes and ears open for the updates from you guys. But, you know, we&#39;ll also be patient as it as it sorts out, right?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>majority of outstanding is Constellation</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. I just didn&#39;t want to I don&#39;t until we knew what was actually going on. I didn&#39;t think it was worthwhile at least to get you involved in the situation because it literally was just I mean, it&#39;s been piecemeal every single day so far. So it&#39;s kind of real time at this point of as much as, you know, as as much as we know. Um, I think the only other side of it that we&#39;re trying to figure out is so we have a lot that is out in AR right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />..and some of these. So as part of the kind of putting the pieces back together, there were some payments that were supposed to already be in process that obviously were processed and then got bounced back because they couldn&#39;t be deposited into the old account. So I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been redoing those. But again, the problem with that is, is now telling those people what the situation is, that that just buys them more time to have to reprocess and pay again. So I&#39;m only like, I&#39;m I&#39;m on top of those and I&#39;m anticipating hopefully they&#39;re coming in this week. But I think what we&#39;ve been trying to do just proactively on the other side of that is just because we have payroll coming up this coming Tuesday, if we have to personally float money into there while we have AR that is outstanding in there, how do we is there, I guess, just what we&#39;re what we&#39;re trying not to do is have the same issue of what happened when it was Chase and trying to put all the pieces back together. So Joe and I have just been talking about if there&#39;s going to be like a bigger you know, let&#39;s say that we&#39;re both infusing 10,000, 10,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So we have 20,000 that is in there in round chunks. At least we know that once the float is over, then we can take those back and those same round chunks. So it&#39;s not extra confusing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So basically, like because, um, you know, I&#39;m, I&#39;m here for this moment and, and I&#39;m, you know, totally up to speed on on what&#39;s going on. And like, we know that there is like this this cash flow kind of hold and like, jeopardy of like, money. And money out. Um, so if I see, like, these nice round numbers coming in and you say like, this is, this is an infusion. Um, you know, we, we need to, you know, get it paid back. Like, as soon as the money is flowing back through, you know, whether it&#39;s, uh, some banks, like when you are in the online banking, you can, like, make a memo on in the online banking. So like, you could do that and it comes through in the integration or I can see it in the statement or you can shoot me an email. There&#39;s like a bunch of different ways to do that. Um, but that&#39;s, you know, because we&#39;re dealing with this together, it&#39;s, it makes 100% sense to me that you would have to, you know, cover some costs or cover some stuff while things are, you know, sorting out. And so, you know, we&#39;ll be right on top of that because we know that this is like an issue that we have to be tracking and covering in real time. So it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not as though I&#39;m looking back and thinking like, what is what is this look like, right? Pieces together, you know? So it&#39;s totally different.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. And it should be I mean, you know, again, for all intents and purposes, it&#39;s not this should not be an ongoing thing for the next handful of months. So and if it&#39;s if it&#39;s very clear, you know, we&#39;re not going it won&#39;t be like, okay, we had to pay Uline and that was $167 and I paid for that. Like, I think we&#39;re on the same page. We would just do, here&#39;s a bigger chunk. If we don&#39;t even need the bigger chunk in the next week, then we say, let&#39;s get the bigger chunk back out of there because we have that years and years ago where it was, you know, like we infused money and then it was just pulling teeth, trying to get it back out of there, and it just kept kind of building. So, um, I think we just, we just all stay on the same page of what that is. But those are the, those are the main fireworks.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So if, um, so whether you can like add that, um, like the note and the online banking or um, you know, if you can just shoot me an email and say like, hey, you&#39;re going to see a deposit and it&#39;s this, um, you know, something to that effect so that I can add the note, um, you know, in the account to track it. So we&#39;ll, we can keep track of it however, is, you know, most convenient and easiest for you guys. And then, um, if it, if it is easier for you to do, like if you have a personal credit card and you have like a big bill that you have to pay, um, you can do that. Like you can pay a big outstanding bill with a credit card and it would be, um, you know, an owners investment to, to pay off that bill and that would be tracked, you know, as long as we&#39;re, we&#39;re on top of it because that bill would be closed out by, you know, your, your payment to it. I just need to have that information. I can track it that way. And your investment in the business would go up exactly the amount of the bill that you closed out. Like we wouldn&#39;t see it through the business accounts that are in QuickBooks because it wasn&#39;t paid through a business account. I would just need, you know, you to let me know that you paid that and it&#39;s closed out and full. And the adjustment would be to to your investments. And that&#39;s how we would track like what you&#39;ve put in personally to make the business whole while this is all going on. And then that&#39;s how we can track like what would, what&#39;s owed to you essentially.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. The only other...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But no matter what, no matter what method we use to pay, we should send an email with the time and saying what it was no matter what. Right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So. So I just wanted to let you know that either way, like if it is a credit card and that&#39;s, that&#39;s easier than doing like a bulk like cash infusion because of the bank. Like I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know if that would be faster or easier for you. Like if the bank is still slow to like move or hold money. So maybe a credit card is easier...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, we&#39;re... we&#39;re scared to put I was just going to say, we&#39;re scared to put money in the account because the new account, they hold it for a while.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah that&#39;s..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />yeah that&#39;s why I, that&#39;s why I mentioned the personal accounts or credit cards like because it wouldn&#39;t flow through that, that bank, it would just be, you know, outside of it. And so I can still do the same method of tracking and reimbursement, um, if you needed to do it that way. So just, you know, just let me know. And like you said, just either way, just keep me posted and we&#39;ll be able to track it in real time.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, cool. Um, all right, well, let&#39;s that fun ordeal. But outside of that, I guess the other. So in when you email me this morning so the you were talking about keeping everything separate for what we were talking about last meeting, right? With just the separate checking accounts basically.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So in order the so we had talked about the, um the checking accounts to open you did an awesome job like, like stepping up and getting those like up and open. But the main thing that&#39;s super, super integral to being able to create the allocations is that the account that&#39;s going to be the the revenue account, the income account, however you want to call it. Um, that has to be, um, you know, input only its output for allocations, but you can&#39;t have like expenses coming out of it. So it&#39;s going to be isolated to just revenue in order for the allocations to really start. Because if there, if there&#39;s expenses like coming out of it and things like that, then we&#39;re not going to have like a true opening number to to take from the actual cash revenue to start breaking things out into the different areas that we want to like budget for like the, the cost and the labor and the, you know, owners pay profit taxes, things like that. So if that&#39;s all co-mingled into here, that number that we kick things off with, it&#39;s it&#39;s never going to be accurate. It&#39;s always going to be like too low. And then the numbers are never going to work.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. So knowing the current situation, what do we do?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />A great time to set that up. Okay. Um, so basically what you would do is, um, when you&#39;re dealing with, I forget the name of your merchant credit card processor, but like that slow, slow process to get, you know, that back up and running like, whoever you end up being with, whether it&#39;s go Printavo you stay with Stripe or whatever you do, you go to the people that take a long time. Um, that is going to be that income account. And then as you&#39;re setting up new things, nothing goes to that account. It&#39;s just income, right? Like, so we don&#39;t want to pay any bills out of there. We don&#39;t want to have anything else coming out of there. Things like if you have like the stripe fees or something like they have to come out of the same account that the income comes into, like, that&#39;s fine and we can account for that. But aside from that, nothing else, just the allocations to, to feed the other areas that we&#39;re focused on.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>?</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. Okay. So I mean, I guess let me I mean, that makes sense to me. I think just in the meantime of that, I just want to keep the focus on at least getting things fluid. And then if we have to like if payments have to come out of the current what is now the new business account, then I think we just have to work backwards. Unfortunately, just because I don&#39;t want to if I throw that in the circus with them and say, okay, now we need to open up two more checking accounts too. I don&#39;t want to you know, I don&#39;t want things to go completely crazy right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, Yeah. So I want you to kind of, like, plateau and get to a safe place, but, um, it is like a good idea to keep that in mind right now that as you&#39;re doing that, um, you know, I mean, I don&#39;t know, like, maybe it is a good time, like as you&#39;re having to move everything around and shift and change. Like if you do open up the, Fifth Third and second and third and fourth banks, um, you, you will need to change all that stuff around again. Like, so your gusto, um, your payroll accounts.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Your, uh, you know, the recurring bills like your utilities, whatever your checkbook. If you&#39;re, if you write checks for whatever, that will all have to be redone again because they all have to come out of an account that&#39;s ancillary to the revenue account. So just kind of keep that in mind. I know it is stressful to be like, I just want to know that this account works. Yeah, no, I get you, but maybe it&#39;s a good like, cleansing moment to just, like, start and do all the accounts and, like, get them set up while while you&#39;re basically starting with a super fresh place.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Does it does it matter if all of those accounts are within the same bank?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />It does, because if you think about the like the cadence of what we&#39;re doing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Transferring, right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And especially when we first start, I&#39;ll do this for you more frequently so you&#39;re more comfortable with it. But we&#39;re going to be transferring because if you think about I&#39;m isolating all of your money into like, like one bank account. And then we have to, um, you know, distribute it out to the accounts that pay things. And that&#39;s like your living budget. So if it was in a if it was in a separate account, that would take a lot of time.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right, ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, that would be fees associated with it. So for that reason we want those accounts to be in the same account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />The same way. Got it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. So I&#39;ll continue to cross that bridge and see, I mean, the worst. Yeah. I think before doing all of that, I just want to make sure everything is stable, like you said.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I know. I understand the, um, you know, being concerned about that and stuff. So, um, you know, I won&#39;t. I&#39;m not going to be a pusher or, like, a bully about it. Um, but I just thought that maybe that, you know, it would be like, a good moment to to set that up.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, for sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, so definitely keep, keep me posted on that. And like I said, I, I&#39;m so bummed out that that, that happened to you guys, but I&#39;ll, you know, anything you guys need from me definitely let me know. And like I said, if you need to do credit cards and payments and stuff like that, just just send me the information and I&#39;ll make the adjustments to make it work.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, Awesome. Um, what, in the interim, anything else?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, so for the interim, I have, um, I am working on, I have the, uh, round one of the budget that we had discussed. And what I added in was some new revenue streams and stuff like that.

And so I just wanted to go over with you, um, like building out, um, some sales goals and things like that. Um, so one of the things that I added, uh, for our discussion was, you know, outside services kind of focused on Future Shirts and um, like the, the cannabis industry and distributing and warehouse and things like that. So, um, based on the sales that you had had, um, and Printavo, I did my best to come up with that. Um, and, and I kind of isolated those two but kind of kept the other sales.

And I just kind of wanted to get your feedback, like, what if you guys had different, you know, things in the works and, and if you had sales goals for these different, um, like divisions or different areas and then I didn&#39;t um, have too much for like, for example, I didn&#39;t have like embroidery separate from like screen printing or anything that wasn&#39;t in QuickBooks before, but it is in printable. So like details like that, because what we had talked about, uh, when I was initially setting this up was that that wasn&#39;t super duper important to you. So, um, as I&#39;m like, refining it, I was just curious, um, you know, kind of like your, your feedback on that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Just to keep keeping the, like, specifically expenses related to, to screen printing and embroidery or just like.</p><p><strong>has to explain to LG how to make revenue goals.  LG ignores advice</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So for, um, to, to track it for like revenue, like if we&#39;re going to, if I was going to break out, uh, like goals, um, for sales and then if we were going to break out like, like I said, um, a bunch of the sales are just hitting like a sales, uh, line item that&#39;s like Printavo or like screen printing or something. So if we wanted to be more targeted and more, um, intentional in our revenue goals so that we can drive, uh, you know, sales goals for our team members, for you guys, we can set these, um, intentions to, to hit for and then, you know, if we&#39;re, if we&#39;re hitting them, rewarding staff and things like that or, you know, hitting these targets and metrics and things like that. Um, but it&#39;s really hard to, if it&#39;s such a wide net</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />that we&#39;re casting and it&#39;s just like sales.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, I mean we can do that. There can be like a wider one, but so that was kind of like the initial conversation. And then as they built it out, I was thinking that it might need to be even more refined and I can send you the like, rough draft. But I was looking at so like, for example, like Future Shirts and like that kind of like sales category. I had done like a generous projection of like that client and like that category being like $175,000 in revenue for 2023. And just kind of wanted to get your feedback like is that based on what they did for 2022? Are we aligned in that kind of, um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Like is that expected?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Growth and projection?</p><p><strong> LG does no job tracking and has no insight into Stephanies question
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think so. I mean, I think if. If anything, you know, they work predominantly with the touring industry as well. So, I mean, the only thing that would curb that would just be if there&#39;s not many tours anymore, or if we just can&#39;t either keep up with like, let&#39;s say they&#39;re growing and we don&#39;t have capacity, we can&#39;t keep up with their demand, then I would assume it would trickle off. But I don&#39;t see I mean, they&#39;re they&#39;re as stable as anybody else, that would be kind of considered one of our bigger clients. So in the conversations that I&#39;ve had with them is that they&#39;re they&#39;re fine and we&#39;re looking to still continue to grow. So, you know, as long as we protect the relationship, then I think we&#39;re we&#39;re in a good place.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. And then, um, for, for Aeriz, I didn&#39;t see like a ton of orders for that client. And I think we had talked about that. I think I&#39;d say that wrong or picking up the wrong thing. So I just did, um, a different client who I saw was like a, a cannabis manufacturer or distributor. Um, and based on that I have very low sales. So it was like, so I projected 25,000 for 2023 and I think I might be looking at the wrong client.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So I wanted to check on that. Is it the A...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />They have groups though.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I&#39;m just so I&#39;m hearing the word and I&#39;m spelling another word. I think my problem it&#39;s A-E-R.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, it&#39;s..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea. A-E...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So I was like spelling Aeriz like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah yeah yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And it wasn&#39;t I&#39;m like, there&#39;s no client. Okay. So that would be a much bigger projection based on spelling out like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, for sure. There. And I can&#39;t, I&#39;m in Printavo right now, but Printavo doesn&#39;t let you see like just total sales by that person very easily. But yeah they&#39;re, they&#39;re definitely they&#39;re, they&#39;re pretty large.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p><strong>LG anticipates things would stay in that direction (closes out response saying its actually his biggest worry),  yet knows they are exploring other options and even brings up a completely missed point that we just had the same situation and lost the previous business eventually by using wishful thinking, but this time it will work
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Um, I would anticipate that things would stay in that direction. The only other, the only other reason that they wouldn&#39;t is because they&#39;re exploring. So a lot of the like custom packaging stuff that we would do with them, they&#39;re exploring doing it domestically, whereas we do it overseas and the timing is slower. So I don&#39;t know, you know, it&#39;s kind of a toss up. They know, they know what we do and you know that we&#39;ve been able to to do it in the past just based on our, you know, kind of sourcing and pipeline stuff, too. But I&#39;m not really sure where that&#39;s going to to go specifically. But the apparel side, I mean, it&#39;s just I think it&#39;s just a question of if they continue what they continue to do and and how they grow because they had a lot of a lot of and we saw this. So two years ago before Aeriz really kind of came and replaced Cresco. Cresco is on the same path. And they were they were doing really big numbers and they were kind of just throwing money like crazy. And as Cresco got more corporatized, then all of a sudden the budgeting started to clamp down. And then they had more strategic kind of partnerships with a couple other like another marketing firm that they they weren&#39;t just dealing with like apparel and packaging and hard goods production. They were doing a bunch of other stuff. So, so we haven&#39;t seen them in, in at least a year anyway. So that would always be my biggest worry is that they just start to get more kind of corporatized, that people are like, Why are you spending $70,000 on t shirts right now?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So, you know, just to be, just to kind of throw it out there for you guys to, to have the, the draft that makes sense to you because they did want to address that because I was like, that&#39;s not who that client is. Um, then just knowing that I would I would probably project our budget closer to like to target that revenue stream. I would target closer to like 60 000 for 2023, like somewhere. I think that would be more aligned.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />For Aeriz?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Oh, they&#39;re going to be way over that alone. I mean, they have like right now there&#39;s. You see, what we do here is 16. I mean, they&#39;ve got 40, 45,000 just in like currently in production right now anyway. Yeah. Yeah. 40, 40. Well, I mean even out they&#39;ve got 40.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Yeah. That was one month.

I mean, I would like to, you know, it doesn&#39;t. We don&#39;t need to have it concrete right now for the conversation. But now knowing that I would, I would love to just see how that batched out as what we did specifically with them in in a year because that would be a good driver because I know from at least from my point of view, that they are one of the big, big drivers. And you know, out of that almost 3 million, you know, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re even sitting like, let&#39;s say that they&#39;re at a million, then that just scares me because that means they&#39;re, you know, they&#39;re all the eggs are in that basket, then that has a lot of fire potential.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. That&#39;s good to know that like especially that that&#39;s not like a like a, you know. Oh, we can totally, uh, be confident that that&#39;s something that we can, you know, rely on for revenue this year. So, um, looking back at 2022. It was like 500,000.

Like what what percent of your revenue is made up by a certain client so that you can know, like because if a client has the potential to like completely disrupt your business by not being a client anymore, like that&#39;s, that&#39;s good to know. Um, and like, if you got like, rumblings that they&#39;re, you know, going to switch or going to leave or something, like what do you have like a, like an action plan, you know, a, like a rollout plan, Like, are we going to lay off and like, you know, do this? We have someone we&#39;re going to call to be like, we got we want to order. It&#39;s like, you know what I mean? Like, so it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely not, um. I get it. But like you, you do want to be kind of aware of the impact that a top client would have, you know, not being a top client anymore. So definitely,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, for sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Look at those numbers and things like that. So that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. But I&#39;m glad that I talked about the fact that I didn&#39;t realize that that name was Aeriz. So..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />That&#39;s important. So, um, what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll project that out and then we can go through like scenarios, like if things changed or whatever. So that&#39;s really important for the budget. Um, and then looking at like what, you know, the labor costs and things like that for that. Um, and then um, you know, just the cash flow changes, Um, and I think that&#39;s everything. So I&#39;m, you know, just going to make those few adjustments that we just talked about and I&#39;ll share that with you. Um, I&#39;m going to share the open invoice detail as of today, but it really is as of, um, like the ninth in the, in the master, um, communication sheet that I have from, uh, Google.</p><p><strong>SM inquires about LG parking customers money in RBC account (later found to be wanted to inflate numbers for mortgage company to see)</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And then I think there was one other thing that I had sent you guys that was like a Loom video of, um, I think it was a, uh, you a big, big invoice that you guys had. And you did. There was a prepayment for a deposit for a client that was received at the end of 2022.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Goose Island?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So we marked it as like a contra income item on a new invoice and it makes the revenue for this current period, I think it was January, um, looks super low because instead of having like a reduced receivable or revenue item, you subtracted like what was received in a different period. And so that was like a video that I had sent you to try to explain the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br /> Oh, I didn&#39;t even I didn&#39;t even see that. I think I know what you&#39;re talking about. I think it&#39;s the the Goose Island one. It was like $28,000?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />It is Goose Island. Yeah.</p><p><strong>LG says Goose Island does this quite regularly, meaning we most likely pay sales tax on the money since qbo goes thru so many different accountants hands</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. Okay. So how should that be done? And I guess so that scenario is very specific to they do it pretty regularly at the end of the year. They&#39;re just trying to basically clear out budget from their, you know, their budget and they just want to park it. They don&#39;t even know. They just literally tell me we have $28,000, can you make an invoice for whatever. And so we make it. They transfer it. And then when it becomes, you know, it could be 50 million hats for $28,000. And then in reality, they come back and say, we just need 100 shirts. And they&#39;re kind of just using that as credit to like break off to other things. Okay.</p><p><strong>look into this. rexport sales tax reports now that all printavo orders have been zeroed out at line item level and all discounts used by LG that unknowingly effected the reporting as Stephanie states here.
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um. So it would be essentially like a deposit on, um, you know, an invoice. So it&#39;s, it should be like a partial payment, Um, and depending on. You know, like sales tax and your and how your revenue is reported. You know, if that&#39;s not fully closed, then it&#39;s not like a realized revenue item because you don&#39;t want to take like they&#39;re paying stuff so they don&#39;t have a tax burden, but you don&#39;t want to just receive money and be a be a tax burden for them either. Um, so it&#39;s kind of something I just, I want to kind of like look at. Um, and also I just wanted to know like the situation. So if, if they&#39;re like, kind of prepaying or depositing or like, you know, giving you money up front end of year, it happens all the time with tons of vendors and stuff like that. So just to kind of understand like the nothing was in production, like people weren&#39;t working on things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You weren&#39;t there was like no cost associated with that money received at the end of the year. And everything that&#39;s going to happen is going to happen in 2023, right? </p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>not sure what to do, yet consults no one
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Correct. Right. So they so the only is it so... so if you&#39;re in Printavo, it&#39;s the first one was the 700775. That was kind of the dummy invoice that was made. That was the $28,279. And then the what became the real production was the 700939. And that&#39;s probably where you do it. Yeah. So like all the way at the footer of that, like in the fees, I just have credit from the 700775 applied which was that $28,000. So I mean if that&#39;s the wrong way to do it then then that&#39;s fine, we can do it however, I just didn&#39;t know how to like show it as something and not have the original one. The 700775 still showing as a balance. So I just zeroed that out basically like discounted it 100% just so it&#39;s not showing in our AR. Now there&#39;s two that are due currently.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I know, I kind of thought so, but I needed to just have confirmation with you because it it&#39;s two different implications. Like when you were working on it, you know? You know what I mean? So I just wanted to make sure that, you know, it wasn&#39;t like a redo or like, you know what I mean? Like something I just wanted to confirm that what I thought was happening is what&#39;s happening. And then I&#39;m just going to look at it closer and, um, I will circle back with that. And I want to make sure that you got that video. You don&#39;t have to. Basically what I&#39;m telling you is what is on the video so you don&#39;t have to watch it again.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.

I don&#39;t see it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />That&#39;s weird. Okay, so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The last one that I see is just from, it looks like November 2nd of 22.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, if I just search loom, but I don&#39;t see anything else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Oh. Okay. I was like, Damn, I&#39;ve emailed you.

Um, and I&#39;ll resend it, so in case you want to see it, but we kind of covered it here. And then, um, now that I confirmed that what I thought is true, I will kind of walk through what, what a best practice would be for, you know, like a tax implication and like being, having like the best metrics and like the best reporting. And I know it seems like I&#39;m getting like really into the details and stuff here, but but this type of stuff is important because I don&#39;t want you to have like an overstated revenue in the previous period and then it&#39;s going to overstate your costs and understate your revenue when you&#39;re actually working on the product and this and that. So I&#39;m just going to kind of show you that. But don&#39;t worry too, too much about it because I catch these things and that&#39;s what I do. So.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>says not technically "laundering"
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. Um, no, I mean, knowing that is good. I mean, I think because it&#39;s not like that&#39;s an ongoing thing. But now knowing that, I think if it comes up, I&#39;ll just make sure that you&#39;re at least in the loop and saying, Hey, here&#39;s. Even before we do anything to say, here&#39;s what they&#39;re asking. Like, is this something that we want to do? I think my mentality at the end of the year is just, okay, sure, if you want to float some money in there, then then great, we&#39;re floating some money.

But um, the only so another situation that we or a conversations that I&#39;ve had with them is they have sometimes they&#39;re not able to specifically sponsor or to pay specific vendors for something. So let&#39;s say that they&#39;re going to pay whatever $5,000 to us and they want to pay $4,000 to sponsor something else. They can&#39;t specifically hand over that money to that client. So it&#39;s not like we&#39;re we&#39;re not laundering it, but like it transactionally, they&#39;re trying to put it through us to be able to pay those vendors. Is that like, how would that scenario ever or is that just something we just talk through when it because every time they brought it up, I&#39;m confused and I&#39;m like, sure, whatever. We&#39;ll just talk about it when it happens and figure out what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Has it happened before? How have you guys done it for them?</p><p><strong>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gjhL-jPJnWeCiuc10jHq6oKgnQ6L-5uw&usp=drive_fs

Um, yeah. So basically it&#39;s it&#39;s like a pass through moment where you would have like an item on your invoice to them that&#39;s essentially like zero markup, like because or, you know, zero margin because you&#39;re going to invoice them for something and then you&#39;re going to turn around and give it all to somebody else and you&#39;re not going to make like a profit on it. And so if you&#39;re like, if you&#39;re truly like, job costing and we&#39;re like doing real like project reporting and stuff like that, we would see that, you know, the hats or whatever for this company. You know, you had a 35% markup margin on it and then, you know, your service was price of this and you made this and that on this project. But then when it comes to that line item, there was no profit on it because you shouldn&#39;t profit on hat part of it, you know what I mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So it was just a pass through moment where they needed you to receive the money and then pay it out to the like promoter person or the, you know, donation, the charitable contribution that it gets.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>very interested in a hypothetical
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, yeah. I mean, do I think I&#39;m, I&#39;m thinking even like, so in that last transaction then it what do we have to do? Like are we then 1099 that person because technically, you know, let&#39;s say just for easy numbers, it&#39;s $5,000. They want to do $4,500 worth of hats that were then going to give to that thing. And they also want to donate $500 to that organization if it&#39;s all coming through us. And ultimately, if we&#39;re handing over a check for a payment, then what? Like, what does that even look like? And is that over complicating and opening us up for like, are they just circumventing all the other tax stuff to deal with?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I was kind of wondering what their reason was that they like, why can&#39;t you pay a charity? But um, you like, what did they do? But, um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s because. It&#39;s because they can&#39;t. They specifically, like, they&#39;re not allowed to, I think, because of their distribution or how they&#39;re a distributor. They can&#39;t legally, like Goose Island couldn&#39;t just say, Hey, we&#39;re giving this bar, you know, $10,000 because it&#39;s not. It&#39;s whatever. However it works in that world, they&#39;re not allowed to do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea. Because of those laws. Yeah. So, um, you would 1099 like, um, whoever it&#39;s going to. Exactly. And that would be your pass through, like, so you received X amount of money and then you paid X amount of people for this and it all comes out in your tax return too. So like you would see, um, and whether or not they&#39;re 1099 eligible or not, like if are, um, you know, exempt for whichever reason, what the input and the output like what&#39;s offset um, is your, is your net revenue. So because it&#39;s a pass through because you have 5000 in and then you have 5000 out on the total project for Goose Island like that will net to zero. So you&#39;re not making money. So on your tax return, you&#39;ve reported 5000 in and then you&#39;ve reported 5000 out because you&#39;ve paid a charity donation foundation and that net zero.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And so your business who has a tax return and so whether or not their 1099 eligible I love that you&#39;re thinking about 1099s and all that. So maybe we will. Maybe we won&#39;t. It depends on their entity status. But at the end of the day, your tax return will show that net wash where it&#39;s zero because you received and then you gave it away.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. All right. Yeah. I mean, I think we just want it when or if it comes up, then we&#39;ll just talk through it too. But I&#39;ve always been confused with that situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I would love to talk through that and just make sure that it&#39;s like on the level and that there&#39;s nothing being missed, but it should be just a pass through.</p><p><strong>same situation cash stashing scam this with LG wifes Employer Constellation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. All right. So yeah, I think that&#39;s the only other ones that, um, yeah, I think so. Constellation has their fiscal year ending too, before the end of this month and so they&#39;re kind of a similar so it wouldn&#39;t happen outside because their fiscal year is not normal. So if they want to do the same thing, is that something that I just bring up to you? Like if we have a rep who literally says I have $2,500 that is left here, like we just want to park that money with you guys, we just say, That&#39;s fine, pay us and we&#39;ll just credit it.
