We&#39;re recording, Lucas. What&#39;s up?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So I&#39;m trying to get to the bottom of this email situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What do you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I can. I spoke with Google, and I can see that you transferred over. A bunch of stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, but what you could see is it was an accident and I didn&#39;t transfer. And the way that, you know that is, you have so much shit that it says it takes like 40 or 80 hours to back it up before you could even get it. So I had a Google vault or not Google vault, Google Cloud. What do you call it? If there&#39;s a Google Cloud account that we had, that was... temporary. Not a temporary, a trial. It was free. 

And I set it up for us to use the API shit, and the trial was up and I had to delete the licenses off us, and instead I deleted it from the admin page. It like, took me to the admin page and it hit... I removed the license but it said delete and I clicked it. And then it said it&#39;s going to take 40 or 80 hours or whatever. I was like &quot;Oh, fuck.&quot; And I hit the button back. And then I didn&#39;t re-add you and Patrick back, which is why those two things happened.

And when I just went back, I thought it was a credit card. I reset the whole thing. I changed the credit card thing, and it came back. So, I mean, I didn&#39;t delete it. And I don&#39;t have your shit. You could see that nothing was actually transferred. Because yeah, I mean, even... even Google it. It says it takes like 40 to 80 hours or some shit. And I didn&#39;t do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, that&#39;s... that&#39;s fine. I mean, I think I just... you&#39;re... you&#39;re... I&#39;m not trying to accuse you. I don&#39;t want to accuse you. Just... If there&#39;s... you&#39;re more than welcome. I&#39;m not trying to come at you aggressively. There&#39;s nothing that I have to hide...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...in my email. Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, dude, I&#39;m telling you, I... we had this stupid Google cloud thing. I could show you the fucking trial and all that stupid shit. I have it and I&#39;m showing you how you when you go to remove licenses. I mean, I&#39;m happy to show you it says remove licenses that says remove user. And when it goes to the remove user, it flips back to the admin. And I just clicked the wrong button. But, I mean, I didn&#39;t even realize that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I just have from... I&#39;m... I mean...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Call Google and see if they... if it even went to me. They could see that. I mean, tell them ask them if you could see if it even finished. Yeah, I&#39;m telling you. I mean, even Google it. If you even Google it, it says that. How do I even make this faster? It says 80 hours and shit. It&#39;s days. So, I mean, take take a look. But no, I didn&#39;t do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, again, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m not... I&#39;m not concerned because there&#39;s nothing more than welcome if you want.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I understand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If you wanna go through my email, that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay, I understand, but I&#39;m telling you. Come on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So. And this doesn&#39;t have to be... I mean, I&#39;m so fucking unreal sick that... that&#39;s why I sound like hell, but there&#39;s there&#39;s so much involved in all of this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No... no... there&#39;s not. There&#39;s nothing involved in it. So, I mean, I would just suggest you turn everything over and just turn yourself in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Upturn? I don&#39;t know. What do you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Honestly... like... I&#39;m not... Joe... I&#39;m not trying to have like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you had nothing going on with Fifth Third at all? You and Len? Nothing. Len never sent you any emails of mine? Nothing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Nothing going on in terms of what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Just answered the first question that I just asked you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I have... I have... I would need to look back and the only thing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You can&#39;t remember if you illegally did shit with Len?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I would have never... there&#39;s nothing to my knowledge that I would have illegally done with Len whatsoever.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay, that sounds very definitive. But either way, you did what you did. You know what you did. All the fucking shit to the accountants. The meetings without me. Telling me you don&#39;t have to have the meetings with with me. Calling the bank, or going to the bank and getting me.... getting security shit put on there so I can&#39;t use it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Can we just...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. Okay. No... well I mean, there is... there is no talking. There&#39;s no talking about it. You did all these things and you know you did. And I have the proof to prove it. You don&#39;t have to say anything, so that doesn&#39;t matter to me. So we could just share in this debt until we figure it all out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Sharing? You&#39;re talking about the debt of the company.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Uh huh.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m aware of that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s also...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean... well, so... I mean... well, what&#39;s up? What are you calling about? Besides just the email, you know, you&#39;re not calling to apologize for destroying something that I... that we built for 16 years. You did it on purpose. And it&#39;s 1,000% clear. You&#39;ve told me you&#39;ve done it on purpose. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s nothing that was done on purpose.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Really? The guy, the head of sales stopped doing sales so it would tank and continued to only outsource shit for his wife&#39;s company for fractions of... of percentages of for profit? And then going to the accountants telling them bullshit stories? So you could say, &quot;well the accountants say...&quot; Well, come on. Spare me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I, I really haven&#39;t. I mean any conversations that I&#39;ve had with Stephanie and Sherri.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Just forward them to me, all of them. And then we&#39;ll be fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s not...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then why why won&#39;t you just forward them to me then?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Because I don&#39;t... because they were phone conversations.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, there&#39;s emails. There&#39;s emails. You said there&#39;s emails and you said I don&#39;t have to share you on them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Then... look... in the end...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, why is it... well, just answer. I mean, it&#39;s clear. Why would you not forward the emails to me for the company that I own, for the email accounts that I own, going to the accountant that I pay. Why? Just... I mean... what&#39;s the good reason?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Because I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re... I don&#39;t understand what the tactic is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t matter what the tactic is. The state&#39;s attorney will get it from you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, if you have my emails.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I do not have your emails.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, and again, contact Google, look up anything you want and see how long it takes to get that shit. There&#39;s the answer right there. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s fine. But I&#39;m telling you and I don&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re done telling me shit. I know... I know what&#39;s going on. I know that you&#39;re in a rush to go get your pizza. I know what you were doing that whole week when we were doing the, um... the bank shit. I know what you went to go do on your your day off that week. I mean. So I mean... so again, nothing you say matters because everything you&#39;ve said to me since we&#39;ve started has turned out to be a lie. And you could say whatever you want, but we&#39;ll just let the judge figure it out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The judge can figure out whatever they want to figure out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, and we&#39;ll just have to wait. And we&#39;ll just wait.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What I was trying just to say... that I don&#39;t... it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, unless you say everything goes back to before you broke it, I don&#39;t want to hear anything. You tanked this on purpose. You got till tomorrow to fix it. Tuesday, we&#39;re showing up to work. There&#39;s still money coming in, so you got till Tuesday. And then I would also turn myself in to the state&#39;s attorney. This is fucking... this is out of state crime, so...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What? What would I be turning myself in for?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Just for what you know. It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m not going to play this game with you, but... Alright, so you&#39;re going to unbreak everything you fucking did. How are you going to fucking get the... how are you going to get to the bank and tell them that you fucking lied and then fix my fucking name with them? How are you going to do that? How are you going to make it so I could get a fucking bank account at all because of your fucking lies to the banking industry with my name?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They don&#39;t have anything.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>LG lies about JZ taking 8K and gets caught</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You said to the bank that I stole $8,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I did not say to the bank.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then why does it say that in the fucking thing that I received from your lawyer?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Because they specifically said that the bank is contacted to say &quot;Look, this is what the situation is...&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So exactly what I said. I mean, it&#39;s embarrassing, Lucas, This is on recording. I just asked you a question. You just lied. And then you come up with a bullshit, embarrassing explanation like... I&#39;m like... I&#39;m your idiot friend who has to just go along with whatever you say, no matter how it jumps. So just keep talking. It&#39;s recording and you know it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t.... all of anything that you...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All your all your talking right now is just helping me so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. Again, the the intent and the same conversation that we had on Friday.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So my question my... my question to you is, when are you going to fix it? Because the last time we actually talked, we said... &quot;I am up for whatever will make you... whatever is ideal to you&quot; and we ended that conversation with &quot;Oh, well, I guess it&#39;s up to me&quot; (this is you saying it) I guess it&#39;s up to me to figure out what I&#39;m going to do. And then not even six days later, you just said, &quot;nope, not fast enough.&quot; You literally said that. So... and then said you bet we are going to be bankrupt in a mere months, showing your intent to crash it. And this isn&#39;t even what I&#39;m talking about turning yourself in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It was really just my forecast. For real.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay, you&#39;ve been forecasting it for four months and done zero in any of the meetings. And when I ask you where anything is, you don&#39;t give it to me. So again. Make it easier on yourself, Lucas. I would tell all your investors... I mean, you think I didn&#39;t talk to Blake? Do you think?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re welcome to talk to whoever you want.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I have.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I&#39;m just saying, Lucas. You&#39;re not as smart as you think you are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not... it has nothing to do with...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. Okay, I&#39;m saying you know what you did. Find a way to fucking unbreak it. You got till Tuesday because we all show up and I want my fucking access to everything reinstated. That&#39;s a that&#39;s a nonstarter. You don&#39;t get that done,  we don&#39;t talk. We don&#39;t talk until we get back to the level playing field that you destroyed.

We... we got people dying to give us money. People... they don&#39;t even know how to give us money fast enough and you&#39;re playing a game. You want to take it to zero? We&#39;ll go to zero. And you&#39;ll go to zero too. And... and... we&#39;ll see. You know, I mean, there&#39;s court cases and, you know, you&#39;re on the hook for all my court fucking fees, right? So we&#39;ll start with that. No, do your thing, man. You&#39;re smart.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The same. The same thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Again... again... again... you got till Tuesday. I&#39;d figure out how to get me on that bank account. Not my problem. And I want... and I would also... we should have a meeting on Tuesday with Stephanie and Sherry, and you could tell them what the fuck you did. That&#39;s... and that&#39;s before we start talking. I&#39;m not talking until I am put back to where I was before you decided to defame me and slander me to banks, to accountants that I pay, to... to my employees?

I mean, Lucas, like, everything you did, is literally the worst possible thing you could do to get caught on fucking audio, right? I&#39;m... anyway, we got till Tuesday. So anything else? Call Google too. Call Google and see if I got your shit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t... it... whether you did or not its just the fact that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, Lucas. I&#39;m done listening to your bullshit. You know that? When you bullshit me, I sit and look at you laughing and then just go along with it and... Oh, it&#39;s so funny.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So your... your demand is that, you...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, there is no demand. There is... hey... you know, all this illegal, stupid shit you did? Undo it. That&#39;s not a demand. I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s in your best interest because that&#39;s where we could start talking. And I got forever, bro. I don&#39;t have pizza places and investors and fucking all sorts of fucking other shit. Oh, you know what you did? Oh, I did forget. No, no, I&#39;m not gonna... I&#39;ll let the state&#39;s attorney...

You emailed me something once by accident, actually, a couple times. And I just been holding on to it for years, but... Oh... you don&#39;t really look at your fucking signatures very often, I can tell you.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean, My signatures?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What do you think I mean?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I honestly... I don&#39;t know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think the conversation that there is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, there is no conversation. I&#39;m talking to a criminal. There is no... I&#39;ve done nothing but stand here and and even work for free for for months. And then I go to finally, after being drained so long just to go get two months of our agreed upon, 4000 per per month, and you... you send a letter with my name or what... however the fuck you did it?

I assume you went in and made all sorts of false statements. So I would I would get I try to remember all the false statements that you made. Write them down, because I want to see those, because I&#39;m going to get... I&#39;m going to need an in-person meeting with you and Fifth Third and Len, and we could all figure it out and you could tell them what was untrue, which is all of it. And that&#39;s the starter.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I don&#39;t understand what Fifth Third has to do with anything, really. The only reason that Fifth... okay ever even involved was because of the situation that you had with them, which...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Really is that... is that it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, I mean yes. That&#39;s what really set everything into motion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay... Okay... but, I mean, you already said at the very beginning that you couldn&#39;t remember with you and Len. You realize that you just contradicted what you said.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know I love when you mumble and you show your hand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s no hand, Joe.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Really?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Every single sequence of events.... I mean, there&#39;s no nobody. Nobody ultimately cares.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, I know. I know because I have everything. So everything you say is just... this is early morning comedy to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, so...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s no talking, Lucas. Unbreak it. You know what you did. You know that you got to fix it, and it&#39;s only going to just help you. I&#39;m not helping you out of this. You are just helping yourself. Like I&#39;m giving you more... I gave you opportunity to undo it several times. Now all you&#39;re doing is just lessening the blow on yourself. So it doesn&#39;t matter to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But... but... but here&#39;s what... the what...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Do you do you think that...? This isn&#39;t a conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s why it&#39;s impossible, because I don&#39;t understand what...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. You commit crimes and then you think that you could talk your way out of it. I have nothing to do with what you did. There&#39;s nothing you could say to make it better. The crimes are the crimes. And again, we could go sit with Fifth Third.

When are you coming down here? Oh, yeah... you know what I did see? Where are you going in June? I saw it on the credit card.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It is actually a trip booked for Chicago.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. For what? You could answer to me. I&#39;m your partner.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Probably because we probably need to talk about a lot of things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, because you drove the conversation to here? You shut me completely down. Oh, I&#39;m again... I&#39;m not even going to take the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The point is that because never have...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There is no... we know what the point is. The point is &quot;we need to shut down.&quot; You think you&#39;re so smart because... and you spent all this time working on your new business instead of our current business. And you... you even tried to get investors who are our customers. Um. I don&#39;t know what you think that I don&#39;t know. You think that I don&#39;t talk to people?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re welcome to... Joe...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, I have. And they, they they fucking offer shit to me. Like, look at this guy.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, that&#39;s.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t need your blessing on it. I&#39;m letting you. I&#39;m just letting you know that. Guess what? You&#39;re not as smart as you think you are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Thats fine, but I hate to tell you...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And there&#39;s... you could tell me whatever you want, because this just all goes into my... my recording collection of agreed upon recordings that I just play for myself so I could remember that I&#39;m not insane.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What is what...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, is there anything else? I have...  I have my kids here. You&#39;ve taken my money, my business, and now you&#39;re not going to take my time. So I answered your questions. You know what you did. Now...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />As do you, that you attempted to have all of my emails transferred.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then why would I. Why would I cancel it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Exactly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re welcome to them anyway.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />None of it makes... Exactly. So then again, you&#39;ve told me a hundred times, &quot;check my emails&quot; and I don&#39;t. So again, you could call them and they could tell you it was not transferred. And if you don&#39;t even want to take the time. Google &quot;how long does it take to fucking migrate my shit?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I know. So again, when do I get my money back and my business back? Oh, it&#39;s Tuesday.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Thats what I said. Lets figure out what is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, there&#39;s no you don&#39;t... you don&#39;t get to burn down the house and give me an estimate to fix it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The house is not burned down. The house is exactly what we&#39;ve both been trying to do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh. Okay. Lucas? Lucas?

No, no, no, no. You have asked me zero. The... the point of the matter is, none of this matters, because when I push in front of the state&#39;s attorney, the amount of work that you&#39;ve done as a CFO, it speaks for itself. So anything else?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But what, for real what do you want from me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s nothing, Lucas. You&#39;ve destroyed it. You&#39;ve destroyed it. And you fucking went and went behind my back and talked to Filberto and Jeff and sent them letters. And you think I&#39;m fucking dumb?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t send them...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And not letters. Texts saying &quot;get worried...&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All I said was I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Look, again, I&#39;m not arguing with you. That&#39;s illegal. That... that is sabotage. Okay?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;ve never told them that. I&#39;m telling you that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Really? Lucas. Lucas. Lucas. You think Jeff didn&#39;t forward that to me immediately? Shocked at your behavior? Saying, look at this. &quot;You tried to tell him to stop talking and he kept on doing it, and look what he just sent me.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I have the text as well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I literally just apologized and said, all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Again, Lucas, I saw it. So again, you don&#39;t get to reset reality with your with your with your half truths. There&#39;s I know what you said. I saw.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It. That&#39;s wrong. The conversations that... Filberto has been the one that has said that he&#39;s... I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s no... there&#39;s never been a reason and I would never do that anyway.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas. Just stop talking. You&#39;re wasting my time. Anything else?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s just sad, Joe.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know it is. What&#39;s sad is you think that you could do what you did, and now you will see how sad it is. And it has nothing to do with me. Anything else, Lucas? Because I&#39;m about to hang up. So figure out how to figure out the bank thing. And I&#39;m not playing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Dang thing would have to be figured out when I&#39;m there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. So... yeah. Okay. So I&#39;ll see you Tuesday. I will see you Tuesday. Goodbye.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the world’s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-m4a-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your m4a files to text">Automatically convert your m4a files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="powerful integrations and APIs" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/integrations?utm_source=embed">powerful integrations and APIs</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automatic transcription software" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed">automatic transcription software</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="secure transcription and file storage" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/security?utm_source=embed">secure transcription and file storage</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="enterprise-grade admin tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/admin-tools?utm_source=embed">enterprise-grade admin tools</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
