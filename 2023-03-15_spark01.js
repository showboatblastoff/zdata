We&#39;re kind of didn&#39;t want to really get into anything without you. So the only thing I really said was that, um, I was going to make notes in that Google sheet that you guys shared just to kind of, uh, share what, what I&#39;m seeing and any questions that I have on the due to from stuff so that we can make you guys whole or just make sure that there&#39;s no kind of duplications of efforts or expenses being recorded and things like that. Because I just want to make sure that everything we come out of this with 100% accurate records and nothing is, um, you know, like any hanging chads, any loose items, anything like that. So I just wanted to, um, one of the if I can just make comments on there, I think that&#39;d be best because one of the things like for the Zelle stuff that was, um, due back to you, um, it says that you were already reimbursed, but I don&#39;t see anything like 1 to 1, like, whatever. With the payment to an employee.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Like, I don&#39;t see anything thats like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s a whole thing that&#39;s like, did you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t mean to cut you off, but Luke, did you give her access to that sheet?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, she has it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />On the second, did you see the second tab where it says each one? and then I have the actual checks showing which was for each payment.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So I see the, um, I see the.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I have the 1 to 1. I have the one to ones.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Yeah. So I just wanted to see that you were reimbursed or if, if it&#39;s still owed to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was reimbursed for everything that says I was reimbursed. I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Since I don&#39;t have access to the bank account, I had to do it through payroll to myself as a reimbursement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Gotcha. Okay. All right, perfect. So I&#39;ll look I&#39;ll look in there to make sure that that&#39;s, um, how that came out. Because I see everything else. I see all the replacement stuff. So I just wanted to make sure that, um, like how it was reimbursed to you. Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, there&#39;s. There&#39;s notes and everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Awesome. Yeah. You guys have been really, really great about tracking everything, and, um, you know, everything looks really good, and I&#39;m super excited to see, um, the profit first account set up, so that&#39;s huge and exciting. Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh we have it set up, you said?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Yeah. So those accounts are live in there. The only thing that I need in order to kind of push that forward onto the next step is to, you know, kind of the biggest part of that. Um. You know, profit first set up is determining which account is going to be income. And so right now you have that new bank account that&#39;s active. It&#39;s kind of, um, every account right now, right? So you have deposits coming in and, you know, everything coming out. So basically I think I kind of told you guys, it&#39;s like Sophie&#39;s Choice. You need to decide, like if you&#39;re going to move your deposits to a new income account or you&#39;re going to move the whatever&#39;s like on an auto debit or whatever to your new, um, like cost of goods and OpEx accounts and things like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m still trying to figure out when we&#39;re going to set up the group, the joint bank account. Are we required?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It is a joint.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It can&#39;t be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s a joint bank account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s got my name on it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Hmm. No, it doesn&#39;t. I was looking at it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, well let&#39;s address that later so its not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t sign anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re not a signer on it. You can&#39;t be a signer on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I&#39;m not. So it&#39;s not a joint account, Correct?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It is a joint account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Can you be a joint account and not be a signer?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, you can be on the account as like a business owner and not be a signer so you can have different rights on an account. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, 50/50, we&#39;re supposed to be able to agree on that, correct?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />If you guys are 50% shareholders, then, you know, you guys can have, uh, as many signers as you want on the account. You guys can you know... work on that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But, but can he get an account? Can he get an account with only him on it? When I say I want to be on a joint account with both of us being on it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I mean, I would for transparency, I would have you guys all be signers. It would be beneficial to have, uh, you know, that sort of like check and balance to have.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, because I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t agree to being this was supposed to be a in the middle account, an interim until we find a new account. So we could both be on it legally. And I just I&#39;m not seeing that conversation happen. I was just wondering the legality of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I think that that&#39;s just a piece of paper that they will probably do for you. I think that that, um. Like I&#39;m signers on my clients accounts and it&#39;s it&#39;s super simple for them to for you to get that updated is one step...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But if I&#39;m saying isn&#39;t the law a joint an actual joint account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s, like, a law.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I believe it when there&#39;s no when there&#39;s no agreement that defaults to what the default is, which is two signer joint account. But I was just wondering if you knew anything about that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Um, that&#39;s a great question. I can definitely check for you. We have, um, a number of legal clients, um, and I can check and make sure that you guys are compliant and stuff like that. I&#39;d be happy to do that. Thank you. I&#39;m not sure thats a legal requirement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t mean to cut you guys off. I didn&#39;t mean to cut you off and take us down this road either. I apologize.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />No, no, no. I think it&#39;s great to, to check, you know, all the boxes and cross all the T&#39;s and dot all the I&#39;s. So I can definitely look into that for you guys. Make sure that you&#39;re super...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m in a meeting right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Who was it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, Let&#39;s proceed.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. Sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, go ahead.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Um, so that&#39;s like the, you know, aside from just getting that sorted out, the the main thing that we want to do is to make sure that. We decide what is going to be the income account and isolate that. And then from there we can place all the other accounts into their rightful, uh, you know, homes and start the allocation. So that&#39;s just the first step. And I don&#39;t necessarily want to make that choice for you because it&#39;s going to be you&#39;re going to have to, you know, move things around between like where your clients are, you know, depositing money to and where you&#39;re like, ACH deposits are going to, the merchant accounts, things like that. And then anything that&#39;s like an auto debit. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s just very important that you guys make that decision and then stick with it. And then from there, everything else will fall into place.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s fine. I mean, that&#39;s been the biggest undoing of this, is that there&#39;s still I mean, that&#39;s one of the multiple reasons of the cash flow issues of there&#39;s still payments that are coming in that they don&#39;t they&#39;re either sending to the old one that are bouncing back. And I mean, that&#39;s part of the reason I&#39;d like to not undo that as of right now until things get get stable because we can&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So do you would you want to have the current account be the income account and then move the expenses to one of the newer accounts? Would that be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, just in the in the in the meantime, because there&#39;s no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;d have to ask the signer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s... I... you know what, Stephanie? Can we reschedule the call? I don&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We should...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t feel comfortable.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I would like to talk legally to Stephanie right now on Zoom that&#39;s being recorded.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Stephanie, I don&#39;t want to put you in an uncomfortable position here. I mean, I think.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Almost as uncomfortable as I am having zero access to any bank accounts and no conversations, that does make me uncomfortable. And we&#39;re talking about bank account stuff now. And right now, I am unable to make any determination on anything because that&#39;s not the account that I wanted to be in. It&#39;s been over a month and this is not how 50 over 50 works. I hate to make you uncomfortable, but it also makes me very uncomfortable to not be heard and be left here to run this entire place in Chicago without even a thought.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I would like to mention those payroll checks that came out of my personal account, came out of my personal account because I was unable to access the account and was told to just lay people off. So I took all our history of...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not going to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I took all our history of sales and went down the line and I got charts and everything. And you could see the profitability of these jobs have completely tanked. These massive jobs that are 20, $30,000 are really bringing in like two grand, 1500. And it takes up all our time. There&#39;s a lot of our issues right there. And I&#39;m happy to share this sheet. And I feel like this is something that the CFO should have handled. But I went through all the way back to 2019, and I&#39;m happy to show even the amount that each sales person because... a lot of this stems from...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Have you ever heard of a company that had one sales person?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just again I want to interrupt. I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Want to I&#39;m asking Stephanie. She works with other screen printing businesses.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You&#39;re fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m asking you, have you ever heard of a business? Have you ever have you personally ever worked with a business that had one sales person in the screen printing industry? I think that&#39;s a relevant question I&#39;m asking you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um... You know, I have a lot of clients that have. More than one, but they also have people in different roles too. People wear many hats. I would say that&#39;s fair to say.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So you&#39;re looking at sales to be...?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m going to have to start up a whole new sales team because I feel like I&#39;m not being assisted here. So I already got it all together. I did it before. And I have on the chart, you can see all our numbers go up. In fact, hey, bing, bing, bing to me while running the business and not being a sales person, I&#39;m pretty close behind you in sales, which is pretty shocking.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But if we want to talk about why we&#39;re in this money hole, it is because we need more people selling stuff because instead of just racing to pay our bills. And then thinking that that&#39;s huge amount of money we just brought in means something. That&#39;s the whole issue in itself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, we could sit here and lose our minds about this and that. But there&#39;s a reality to running a business, and I believe it involves sales usually. So, I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, wouldn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t you agree that the answer out of the hole is more sales?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Well, that&#39;s a circular pattern like so if your pricing is off and you know all of that stuff is is off, like if things aren&#39;t priced correctly, if you&#39;re, you know, overstaffed and you know you have a lot of downtime, things like which we do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And we&#39;re going to I mean, because we are slammed when we take all these rush jobs and then we sit and do nothing and have arguments, not me, the employees... I have, I have employees coming in with interpreters, parents and stuff to talk to me about issues that people are having on the floor.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I can&#39;t just start cutting hours and stuff because we&#39;re going to need them again to not need them again, again. And this this team is amazing. And I feel like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t want this to be a wages game.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s a sales game. I mean, it&#39;s 1,000% clear to everyone.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I mean it&#39;s a... it&#39;s like an efficiency game. It&#39;s like running as streamlined and lean as possible.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which is what we are. We&#39;re bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. When we have our full team, when we had all these sales people, it never stopped. You stop that and the machine falls apart. It&#39;s got to keep rolling.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea. No, I hear you but...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, we could sit here and guess all day. I&#39;m not being outrageous. I&#39;m trying to... the money has to come from somewhere. Look at how much we owe in debt to all these companies.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Not to mention, Lucas hasn&#39;t even taken $10,000. That is not a sign of doing well. This is a sign of trying to put out the fire. Now, that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But on top of it, you also in the background have to be doing something to get this machine kicked over so we could get from under to over. Now, that is something that I will take under my own wing here. And I got everything together. I got my numbers and everything, and I&#39;m going to try to get some sales going again like I did in the last $2 million of sales that I did.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Well, I think that&#39;s great. I mean, that&#39;s definitely part of the equation is there&#39;s definitely like a a revenue number that has to be hit or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean. I remember I asked you what was the weekly sales goal because it used to be for us $55,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And on my chart, we&#39;ve hit it like four times last year. With an average of like $20,000 a week. Which...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I just have it monthly. So I have to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no. But I remember. What was that...? You had some have program that we did.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I have like $59,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Pardon me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I have like $59,000 right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, no, no. Oh, for what? Yeah. And we are like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We&#39;re averaging like $25K and, um. No, I was, what I was saying was you showed us some sort of a platform that Luke and I didn&#39;t have access to. And on there you had the breakdowns where you could choose a date, and it did all this stuff. It was a program. I can&#39;t remember what it was called. It was one word. Do you know what I&#39;m talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Reach, I think? Yeah, it&#39;s either reach or fathom. Yeah. Its a dashboard.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I feel like you. You touched on this stuff on there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Umhmm</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But but I don&#39;t think either of us... still don&#39;t have access to that. So if you could get that to us, I mean, I&#39;d love to take a look at, you know...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I was in there this morning before the meeting and it&#39;s I can it shows that both of you guys are in there. So if you&#39;re not able to access it, I can remove you and resend it because I don&#39;t know how to send it when it shows that you&#39;re in there. So I&#39;ll just delete it and resend it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you could. If you could, that would be amazing because,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Umhmm. Yea I can do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I... I went back every single job from today. I&#39;m all the way back now in 2022. In the middle of it, I&#39;m putting in the price of the goods on everything. I got, the price of shipping, the tax, everything coming out so you can see the actual profitability. And some of them are ultra scary.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Like no profit?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, like ones that we we risk buying $6,000 worth of North Face coats to put on $30 of embroidery on it and we make like $80 or something. There is a lot of there is a lot of stuff like that in there. And once I start taking out the shipping and and the credit card processing, it just it just keeps chiseling to nothing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Well, that&#39;s what so that&#39;s kind of what my point is, is that if you&#39;re always hyper focused on top line revenue and gross revenue, like that&#39;s a, you know, maybe that&#39;s a big order. Maybe that looks like a nice number to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not real.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />But then when you look at the actual profitability of it and the and the, you know, hard cost of it, that&#39;s what we need to drill into. And like if you if you sell, you know, $10,000 to make, you know, $1,000 on it and you have to turn around and like buy more stuff with that or pay people with that, then you&#39;re actually in the hole and you didn&#39;t make anything. You lost money.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And here&#39;s the thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Everything that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry. I was just going to say that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Its ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It will never end. Because when you have one person trying to get, say, $59,000 a week, you&#39;re going for the big fish constantly, only big fish, you&#39;re stuck.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And then you take that big fish. It eats all your time. And it was a wash.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Right. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I went back and I could see the profitability of each one of our employees, like like of each sales person. And they far pay themselves off. I mean, it&#39;s just something if we if we don&#39;t want to have this conversation be three of us staring at each other for eternity, I think that has to go down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />The what has to go down?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sales at all? I mean, just I mean, I understand it. This is the first thing I said. It&#39;s too much on one person.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re going to get stuck chasing gigantic fish.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And then in the meantime, we&#39;re going to have so much downtime that everyone on the floor is going to freak out, which they do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So you want to invest in a salary for a sales person?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No. Oh yea. I mean, invest in a salary. It&#39;s not like we have to pay them 80 grand tomorrow. It&#39;s it&#39;s a weekly thing, you know, I mean, if this person&#39;s not bringing anything in, in one month, we should talk about something, you know? I mean, that&#39;s how this stuff works.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not attacking you. I&#39;m talking about trying to get...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, please don&#39;t, please don&#39;t think that I don&#39;t feel attacked. I don&#39;t feel attacked. I just. I talk like this. I apologize.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />No, no, no. It&#39;s totally fine. So then we would do, you know, if you. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re interested in and, like, that&#39;s your focus to bring in revenue. Um, then what? I would, you know, I would advise you to structure it in such a way that it&#39;s like a base salary that&#39;s minimal and it&#39;s a lot, it&#39;s incentivized like the majority of their revenue is, is incentive driven, like on close, not on like leads, but on on close ratios and things like that, and kind of like really that type of stuff. And I know that we talked about, um, you know, the, the cannabis industry and like that that was like really profitable for you guys. Um, and so it would be more about quality and less about like quantity because that&#39;s where the profit is really driven is like the riches are in the niches. And like if you have like a, like clients or jobs and this is what I was saying the last time is that if you start to kind of really assess what jobs were shit and what jobs were really great, what made you money and what was, you know, really successful, what do you want to focus on?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, I have it by, by by customer. And you could see the profitability of each customer that we have. And some of them are. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Sometimes it&#39;s better to say no to the customer who doesn&#39;t make you any money and just causes you more headache. And taking up...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Our problem is, we get so behind that, jobs just get taken, which I understand you sort of just have to take everything. And then now we&#39;re just constantly on fire and always behind the gun and, you know, always super stressed by the job that brought in like barely anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Well, that&#39;s like I would anticipate that if you brought in a sales person who was put on like a an incentivized, like closing closing ratio, like they would have to build out a pipeline and they would have to be strategic in you know...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not thinking. I&#39;m not thinking sales person, sales person. Go out there and and pound the pavement. I&#39;m thinking like how Lucas and I in the past had sales people who just start by taking over processing the orders for us. Then you just start teaching them little by little, and then you just point them in a direction. And before you know it, that person just starts getting their little team that anything helps. I&#39;m not thinking we go down this cut throat route just yet. Just a person that could work as assistance to Lucas getting him the answers that he needs and, you know, and getting things done</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />and at the same time just filling out these invoices for us, which a lot of the devil is in the details on those because a lot of the... I went down and caught all like even all the errors everything that we&#39;ve had to refund people for. I got those down by job and a lot of them are very simple issues that you know our side, you know the invoicing side, they need to be taken care of. But we could dial that in very easily.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I mean I think that that is at least trying to do something to get in front of whatever it is, because any assistance right there is priceless. The stuff that I&#39;m able to knock out when I don&#39;t have anything on my plate is outrageous. I&#39;ve already figured out AI and programming in Python. This stuff that I have is wild. You could pull up two salespeople, pick any timeline, any customer. It shows the profitability of everything, pulls up a chart, breaks it all out, and you can see everything and it goes it goes all the way back to 2019.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />That&#39;s awesome.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So. I... I think that&#39;s the way out of our numbers hole here is to... just a couple, you know one one more paycheck on some random... sorry but anyway, I didn&#39;t mean to take over but I think that that is what we should be concentrating on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. I mean, um. It would have to it would have to show a big turnaround in in revenue. You know, for for you to add expenses.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, well, I guess. I mean. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You&#39;re not concerned?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m concerned. Well, I mean, we took on the expense of never hiring an accountant for two years, and I wound up doing it on top of everything else. So by just nodding our heads and going along with, &quot;well, we don&#39;t have the money for it.&quot; </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Technically...if anyone on the floor leaves, I should take over their jobs as well. You know what I mean? The machine doesn&#39;t keep going just because. We&#39;re talking $800 every two weeks or what? That&#39;s nothing compared to the hole in hell that we&#39;re in constantly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ll pay that person out of my personal. I&#39;ll get... I&#39;ll drive Uber to pay that person. We&#39;re going to all drop dead over here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Anything else that, uh. You know, you you got going on that you wanted to?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just I think everything I said is just complete standard business. Am I saying anything outrageous?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Now. Um. No, but I do, you know, I think that. We need to kind of hone in on, you know, what what&#39;s going on with the with the cost of goods. You know what? Why is it as high as it is? And if you&#39;re telling me, it&#39;s because. There is issues with invoicing that have to be, you know, comped or things like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not even stuff. It&#39;s not really even stuff like that. It&#39;s just these jobs aren&#39;t very profitable. I mean, some of them are. Some of them are awesome. I&#39;m not I&#39;m not shitting on anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I know you&#39;re not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />For one person to take under all this sails is is insane to me. And I can&#39;t believe that he knocked it out of the park the way he did. But I feel like that&#39;s on a personal goal level because if we&#39;re still under like $25K, you know, per week as average, that&#39;s not good.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And two massive things were Riot Fest and and and Aeriz. If either of those two were to go away last year would have been devastating.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, and we can&#39;t, we can&#39;t... What happens if, you know, Lucas gets sick?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Is it, &quot;well, you know, we can&#39;t afford something to put someone in to do any sales for the next week.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, that doesn&#39;t... it&#39;s we,  if we&#39;re going to get out of the hamster wheel, we have to start moving our way out of there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think I&#39;d also like to address something Sherri wants to to talk about this, and maybe that&#39;s obviously without her being here, too, so that when everybody is here, I think the the salary change that she made from last year needs to be addressed.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I&#39;m not being paid now, so I don&#39;t know what we&#39;re addressing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If I can just finish talking, please. She she wants to address that, too, because it&#39;s based on last year&#39;s numbers. Um, and I think another one of the toppling over of why we have the cash flow issue is because the account was overdrawn last year and so we&#39;re making back up for that because since we had to even out draws, that&#39;s that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you were to. Look at every single year we got paid exactly the same. In two years, we didn&#39;t get $30,000 back from our from our tax returns like we always do. So the amount that goes over that extra $30,000 literally every year comes out to be the same. You could say I&#39;m taking it out real fast, But in the end, we we always ended up with the same amount of money. So which on top of we were able to dig our way out of the hole because I became an accountant and figured it out for two years through the night with Sherri.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Ok. So just to readdress...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, if I make any less, I&#39;m not going to be able to afford what I&#39;m doing here. So, I mean, A: I&#39;m not getting paid right now, nor do I have any access to. But moving forward, I&#39;m assuming that will get worked out. Don&#39;t chisel us because of bad sales. If I decided to not, no production for the next month. It&#39;s not  &quot;Oh, hey, Luke. We got to shell out this week. No one worked, and I just didn&#39;t feel like doing anything.&quot;

I mean, in the end, that&#39;s not ridiculous.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We are supposed to be making a base level something. It&#39;s not just whatever. I don&#39;t have another person bringing money in, so you could blame me, but let&#39;s blame the machine. The machine is limping.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, okay. Thank you for that. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s no blame. I&#39;m just saying, Stephanie, like, she. She just wants to talk with everybody kind of over, I think, over all of those things and see where they land. And I can&#39;t. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But what you&#39;re talking about is putting out a fire. Not the reason of the fire. Yes, we could all let&#39;s smile. We could all talk about the how we could fix it and it will be you and I take less money. That&#39;s great. But that is not the solve for running a business. That&#39;s the solve for that hole that opened up in the floor.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I don&#39;t know what got quite derailed, Steph, so I don&#39;t know if you want to address any of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah. It could be anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um. Well, with the salary. Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not taking less, I&#39;ll tell you that about it. We should fix the problem. I mean, eh, I&#39;m not taking anything, but.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t suggest. No, that&#39;s fine. Um, I just want to. There was just, like, me clearing up the payroll movement from the banks closing, so I just wanted that. That was all. Um, and then I think there was just a few. Questions from Sherry, um, that we still had, uh, left over. Um, I answered most of them. And I think there was just like 1 or 2 and there was something about just evening out the distributions, which I think is the same thing that was just off by a tiny amount. Um. And. So one other thing. Oh, there was improvements. Uh, to the building. That were like a work in progress. Um, and basically I think that they&#39;re just going to be completed and written off, uh, fully expensed for the year? Is that, does that sound correct?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t even. So I see that in her email, but I&#39;m not actually sure what construction and progress that even was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Could it be when we built those walls for the digital room? And the doorway.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />What exactly it says. It says, uh. Construction in progress. That&#39;s the name of the account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Is that the Pat Rosen one?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, it&#39;s digital room office doorway.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />That&#39;s construction. So we&#39;ll just expense that fully. There&#39;s no more work to be done with that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, that&#39;s scope was finished, right, Luke?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I believe so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />It looks to me like it is. Yeah. Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The Cooler Zone stuff. It shouldn&#39;t be maintenance or repair. Those were actual machines that were, they&#39;re air conditioning machines.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Where. Where do you see those in here?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, it&#39;s in her email under the... It just says there was a transaction coded to repairs and maintenance for Cooler Zone on 06/15/22 for $3897. Please confirm this was truly a repair and not an actual purchase. But they were actual purchases.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And I have those under equipment. The Cooler Zone things?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um. I have those as equipment.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So yeah, maybe she&#39;s got it wrong, but they are. Yeah. I&#39;ll double check the machines.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, the only thing. All right. Yeah. The only thing would be is if I just moving things around, try to expense them for you, and I&#39;ll talk to her about that, because there are some 179 like capital. Um, full depreciation that you can take for like any assets and things like that where like normally you would want to like move everything over to like an asset item and, you know, show the best profit and this and that. But this is like a, um, you know, something where you can, you know, write off, um, a full depreciation for anything that was purchased in 2022. And you can actually go beyond, uh, a net negative, uh, loss and you can like claim into negative. So it&#39;s kind of like a really cool, unique moment and going into a negative balance. And in 2022, um, because you won&#39;t be able to do that again, like normally you would never, you could just break even. Um, so just kind of maybe playing around with those types of things. Um. So I think that&#39;s kind of like everything that I have. But the, you know, the main thing that I have in my budget to kind of, you know, show you guys are the.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Like percentages for target and categories. Right. And so I&#39;ll share that with you. Um, I&#39;ll share that in a separate Google sheet if you&#39;d like. But what I did was I had like, uh, a sales percentage for and we talked about this like of your total revenue. If you have, you know, 100% revenue to target like 8% revenue to, uh, like the cannabis trade, um, 5% to live printing. Remember we discussed that like, is there a more strategic way to break down the revenue streams and like what it&#39;s built of to say, Oh yeah, like this is profitable, this is not profitable. Like, oh, we haven&#39;t sold this type of a, um, we haven&#39;t made this type of a sale. Let&#39;s start to market in this direction. So that was like kind of where I was going with that because like if you look at, you know, like maybe embroidery is not as profitable. So, you know, maybe let&#39;s reduce that to 2% of this 100% and bump something else up. Well, we.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Did make a change in embroidery. We now have in-house embroidery here. That&#39;s what those paychecks were, me paying the embroiderers. So now it turned out that the guy who was doing the embroidery for us had screwed us out of $18,000 over the last year by overcharging us from what Lucas was suggesting the charging was. So besides all that 18,000 in the hole, we now are doing it in house for a lot cheaper. So and they&#39;re really good there. So we could start funneling more of that through here. And that is a a good moneymaker.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. That&#39;s awesome. Um, so then that, then that&#39;s like a really great way to look at this. So this is obviously nobody knows your business better than you guys do, so that&#39;s like, this is my jumping off point to kind of show you what how we can start to strategize month over month. And so when I had first created this, it was a it was a month over month annual. So what um. What is going to happen now is just like a super generic monthly one that&#39;s just taking like your goal monthly revenue and compartmentalizing that into the revenue streams. And then based on that, what like if we have a goal right now, if we have we have like 70% cost of goods, but we really want it to be like 50%. So we&#39;re where are we leaning that out? Like, is it in garments, Is it in, um, you know, labor? Is it in, uh, you know, uh, discounts, like where is it coming from.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />From? I mean, I literally, I was going through every single purchase order. I opened every purchase order and attached it to each job so I could see each one. And I was I&#39;m actually, I was. I&#39;ll share it with you. We could see the exact cost that comes of just the garments itself. And some of them are so outrageous. I mean. But it&#39;s. Yes, we do make money on the end, but it&#39;s so top heavy that we&#39;re fronting, you know, like $200 for a coat that we&#39;re going to put $4 of embroidery on. And that affects cash flow big time.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Um, yeah. So definitely share that with me. And then it might affect like how I show this budget. But I think that kind of having this, um, a little bit more, uh, like plane than, than what it was initially with all that kind of stuff in it, um, is really kind of, a little more impactful and it can even be drilled down even more where it&#39;s like, uh, if you have, if, you know, $1,000 walks through the door and your costs are at 70% right now, then you know that&#39;s $700 automatically off. Uh, and you only have $300 to pay you guys the rent, you know, everything else. And if you look at it just that dialed in like, or you know, that plainly, it&#39;s like, shit we need...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I got that. I got that column and we could plot it right out. I got that column for every job, the actual after out the door, no taxes, no shipping, no goods, nothing. Only thing that&#39;s still in there is wages. But I don&#39;t know how to. Dial that in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Well, that would be like the fixed expense, like adding a fixed expense amount, like what your average is to every job like. So if you, you know, your fixed expenses should be pretty static monthly month over month and it shouldn&#39;t really be too crazy. So that should be, you know, if you look at how many days you&#39;re open per month and your average fixed costs, that&#39;s what you add to every single job. And I can calculate that for you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, that&#39;d be so nice.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So that would be like if you&#39;re really honed in on the variable, um, the fixed is, is super easy to do. Um, yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Exciting.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So it&#39;ll be a really great way to add that in. And then you can see the bottom line of, of all your jobs.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So that&#39;s awesome. Um, so that leaves me with, uh, so we have the, the profit first. So, I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />This is where I jumped in. I apologize. You were talking about the Profit First Accounts. You were just talking about the, the accounts being built in QuickBooks and not physical or actual accounts in a bank, correct?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Well, I am talking about physical accounts because I&#39;m talking about what&#39;s going to be an income account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But did we open.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And from there everything trickles down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Did we open those bank accounts?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes. They were open when the other account opened.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. So I just need to know what will be an income account and that has to be isolated in an island by itself that only income comes into and then we move money out as per the budget for all these other accounts. And that&#39;s how the magic of Profit First works.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, before we start moving stuff between accounts, I would like to be on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Copy that. So that&#39;s going to be between you guys.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />But I can definitely look up like, uh, you know, legality and like, all things like that, because we do have, uh, you know, lots of lawyers, uh, in the firm, um, or with the firm. Um, obviously with discretion. I can check with that. Um, and then for the, those detailed reports, I did not know you guys couldn&#39;t see them because I can see you in the reports, which is funny. So I will remove you and re-add you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Thank you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I&#39;ll do it right when we&#39;re off this. Um, and then for the monthly updates. We do, you know, it got a little off the rails there with the bank accounts, you know, being offline and things like that and just kind of trying to chase everything around. Um, so we should be good to go back on track with that. And basically what that is going to show if you&#39;re, if you&#39;re looking at it, it&#39;s just kind of like the weekly nut. Like it&#39;s the in, the out. What&#39;s due, what&#39;s owed, that good stuff. And then we will have the quickbooks reports to support it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />This is on the thing you&#39;re going to share with us?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah that&#39;s, that&#39;s in Google and you guys should have that. But I&#39;ll definitely, I&#39;ll resend everything in an email to make sure everybody has access to everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Thank you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So that&#39;s the weekly. And then in a separate thing is the budget. Um, which I do have annual but I&#39;m going to just break it down into that monthly. And then of course just updating Sherry on what we talked about. Um, and right now I think that that&#39;s everything. Did I miss anything?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are we updating Sherry with?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />She just sent an email because she wants to get um, like your estimated or extension payment out, um, based on like just wrapping up, final numbers and things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Was there anything else?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Not really.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think so. No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Well, so I will send you that wrap up so you have everything and then make sure everybody has access to all that stuff. And we will, um, you know, if you have any questions, when you see that, definitely let me know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;d like to apologize. I don&#39;t mean to make you feel uncomfortable, Stephanie, but these are... we could sit here and smile all we want. There&#39;s real answers to the real problems. And I don&#39;t mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I just, I needed guidance.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah. And I&#39;m not uncomfortable. I would I would directly tell you if I was, I would. I would let you know. Um, so thank you. But you&#39;ll know. I&#39;ll tell you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I appreciate that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Um, but no, I&#39;m fine, thank you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ll share you guys on that. I gave Lucas the sales chart, like the breakdowns of the sales a couple of weeks ago. I&#39;ll share you. It&#39;s. It&#39;s pretty awesome. But I figured out it&#39;s. Oh, you&#39;re a nerd. What do you know about that Google query?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Do you use that Google query?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea I know, I love it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re all about it? I just fell into the world of Google Query and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m coming back.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea. You&#39;re in deep.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m in too deep? (laughing). </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, it&#39;s pretty amazing. It&#39;s pretty great.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />My... my... order as and my.. my select... I&#39;m dialing it in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, it&#39;s pretty amazing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, my God.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I&#39;m super excited for you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s so awesome. And I. So you know what I&#39;m talking about. I got everything that you could flip or see all at the same time or even compare to different people with any, you know, because it goes straight to our main full database, which has all data from Printavo, Shipstation, whatever... Everything else makes its way into the categories. So you could actually pull up and run awesome reports and have links directly to the Printavo, you know, invoice and everything. So I&#39;ll share that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I love that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was actually pretty surprised. Some of our more profitable things are like Tom Labadie, Lucas. So some of like, like, you know, the person that you don&#39;t suspect, the person that always seems like they&#39;re annoying you when you look at how much they brought in because they&#39;re no fuss, no muss. Just keep bringing it through. Holy cow. Tom, I&#39;m sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, We&#39;re going to duplicate those guys. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Ok, thank you Stephanie</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Did we also talk about us losing our tenant?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, there are not a lost tenant, but we didn&#39;t address that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Cutting out. You guys just cut out for a second. I missed it. What was it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />One of our tenants is leaving.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Oh, okay. I don&#39;t think we did talk about that, but if you want to let me know, um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And which is, I mean, it was great having it.  Now, now losing that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea. Obviously.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s not... they&#39;re not a lost tenant, so we can talk over that. But it&#39;s not that&#39;s not what the situation is. So we can address that some other time. But there there&#39;s it&#39;s a complicated issue because they can&#39;t... It&#39;s just a complicated issue. So there potentially there might be a lost tenant, but they&#39;re not they&#39;re not doing anything right now. So it&#39;s not something to address right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />All right. Perfect. Well, keep me posted on that. And, um, good luck. I hope they hope you don&#39;t lose them, because that obviously will be tough. Um, all right, guys, I got to jump off. Um, I will send you that, uh, update that I just listed here with all those items, and you&#39;ll have access to everything if you have any questions when you get that, um, definitely let me know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All right, so 59,000 per week is the new baseline.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, it&#39;s pretty. It&#39;s alot.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s more than double what we&#39;re looking at now. And that&#39;s baseline.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, if we go below that, what happens besides this?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />You&#39;re in a loss and you&#39;ll be servicing a loss.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So you&#39;ll be, you know, technically in debt if you&#39;re going below that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So unless anything changes with. The costs and expenses, but that&#39;s where you&#39;re at.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And we&#39;re saying $59,000 full of all in goods and everything? Or is it with goods taken out?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />UmHmm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It can&#39;t be... okay. It&#39;s okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />All in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All in. Okay. Sorry. What did you say, Lucas?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just. I just want to readdress that at a different time, because, I mean, we could sit here and we could make goals all day long that say that our, our yearly revenue is supposed to be $80 Million, and we&#39;re supposed to be doing $2 Million a week. I mean, I think that&#39;s just a decision...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But if we&#39;re not covering our bills, if we&#39;re not covering our bills, we&#39;re going in the hole.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Statement without you interrupting me, then I can finish a thought, please. It&#39;s just rude. So, yes, covering our bills of the bills that are currently what the bills are, but the health of the business and the health of what what is either envisioned for the business is a determining factor for that. So you can make a decision all day long that says that you have a lifestyle that needs to be sustained and if I don&#39;t potentially agree with that, then I could care less what the sales goals are per week. So we can we can set a goal to to try to attend to. But that&#39;s that&#39;s something that just needs to be...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You mean like when last year when I said I have $30,000 to put back in the account to cover the hole and you said don&#39;t do it because you&#39;d have to put the money in too?
