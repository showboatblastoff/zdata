I don&#39;t know why it goes this way. I understand. So what do we do? So what do we do?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s not a decision or a solve that you or I can make. That is a decision for somebody to legally say &quot;Okay, that&#39;s fine. Heres the situation....&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So, I mean, like like when you said the next step should involve lawyers and I said yes? Why are we still... I mean, there&#39;s no argument. That&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s have that conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I felt that I was doing the respectful thing and having that conversation or attempting to. But if it keeps going to, that&#39;s fine. Then we&#39;ll just talk to lawyers. Then it becomes okay. That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I mean, you and I are trying to have the conversation. You say what the problem is and then we talk about it. Then you say, well, no, let&#39;s talk about a different problem. So I&#39;m literally I haven&#39;t heard anything that we could talk about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />We just went through two. There&#39;s two right there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, and you said workload. And what was my answer? &quot;Fuck you?&quot; 

Was that my answer or was it... &quot;Hey, I&#39;m... I...&quot;

Can we agree that I&#39;ve been trying to make it better and I will continue to?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean. Well, I mean, that&#39;s one conversation that we talked about and that went well. I mean, did something.. If you.. if you would like to revisit that and there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like me to be made aware of, I&#39;m all ears.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t... I think workload is the lowest on the totem pole. That&#39;s something else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then what&#39;s... then what&#39;s... I mean, well, then we solve that one because we&#39;ll just get rid of the work that you&#39;re doing, so there&#39;s less and we&#39;ll get there. What else is there?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s that&#39;s. That&#39;s fine. But in the grand scheme of things, the &quot;we&#39;ll get there&quot;, while I understand and absolutely respect that you&#39;re trying to do that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We could start it... well we could start right now. I mean... I mean if you think that we&#39;ll never start it, I&#39;ll bring out a piece of paper right now and start writing down whatever. I mean...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just don&#39;t think that... I think the current solve for what that is for the time involved is not... that&#39;s fine but that just becomes something that in... it doesn&#39;t happen.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t happen effectively. It doesn&#39;t happen not only quick enough and it&#39;s just not the... it&#39;s an idea of a solve.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Going down a path of saying, &quot;okay, well, we don&#39;t need you to be doing those sorts of things. It&#39;s just going to be all AI generated stuff&quot;, that&#39;s great, but that&#39;s just not a solve for right now, and that&#39;s not something that happens right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. What is the solve for the money?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is no solve. There is generate more sales. The way that I had to do all of last week to try to pound to get all of the money in there to do they only solve is to continue to do all of that which I&#39;m absolutely capable of, but at a certain point there&#39;s only so much that you can try or attempt to do around the clock.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And when it doesn&#39;t happen, it just doesn&#39;t happen.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So what is the other solve of that is the alternative that I opened up with, saying at a certain point it&#39;s going to be time to start laying people off and when that happens, then that&#39;s a different bridge to cross and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Depending where the rest of the conversations go and trying to figure out that if that conversation just becomes &quot;okay, that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s we&#39;re working towards&quot; it&#39;s not something overnight.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If we&#39;re working towards dissolving the partnership as it stands and closing the business, then that&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t happen overnight as well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.So we we should have an idea of what we&#39;re going to... If if we&#39;re going to close the doors, there should be a don&#39;t buy any more stuff clause so we don&#39;t dig the hole deeper. Right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m... I&#39;m aware of that. Yes. Part of that is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Please don&#39;t... I&#39;m not attacking you, I&#39;m just saying these are things that will need to be happen, that will need to happen. And we will both be less happy if we did it wrong and wound up in the hole worse.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So literally, I&#39;m here to say yes to everything and to make it work both in the interim and however else it turns out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, but that doesn&#39;t. Then all I hear is, &quot;okay, figure out what that is and I&#39;ll say yes to that.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s where the conversation... if we were to have a real conversation, we would say, what are the steps to make this happen? Okay, I&#39;ll take this step. You take that step. I&#39;m 1,000% capable of it. I&#39;ll do it right now with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know where else things can....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know you can&#39;t describe what the issue is. I try to help you with that issue and then you want to move on because there&#39;s so many issues. And this is all about how we can&#39;t have a conversation. We&#39;re talking the issues seem to just disappear.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />How are they how are they disappearing? We just regardless... We&#39;re not talking about workload anymore. Thats not an issue.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Let&#39;s make let&#39;s make a Google sheet and I&#39;ll go down the line and we can put I mean, because that&#39;s how it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s facts. If a fact is you have too much work, then the answer is, how do we make... we come up with a way to make it less.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And there still will be work. I mean, if we just say we&#39;re closing today, there&#39;s still work that needs to be done. The whole rest of the day and the whole next day and this and that and the other thing. And we got to go down the line x-ing those off. Otherwise we&#39;re going to bury ourselves.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So, I mean, let&#39;s make a list. I mean, I don&#39;t want you to say that I&#39;ve never tried to hear you on this stuff because I 1,000% have. And I would like to continue to do that.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the worldâ€™s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-mp3-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your mp3 files to text">Automatically convert your mp3 files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="transcribe multiple languages" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/languages?utm_source=embed">transcribe multiple languages</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="enterprise-grade admin tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/admin-tools?utm_source=embed">enterprise-grade admin tools</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automatic transcription software" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed">automatic transcription software</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="share transcripts" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/share-and-publish?utm_source=embed">share transcripts</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
