This is going the wrong way. I didn&#39;t mean any of this to go this way. This is not an argument.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s fine, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m telling you, man, I just... I can&#39;t work with you. I cannot.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are you...? I painted a picture of what I needed, And... and... it is not...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What picture? You haven&#39;t told me one thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It... So if I were to put it together and give ...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t want you to put it together. I don&#39;t want you to put it together. I don&#39;t want it. I don&#39;t want it anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So if... I don&#39;t care what you want. Things need to... as a business, you and I need certain things. And I... I know exactly what it is, but pitching it to you while you&#39;re yelling at me is not the way, and I... and I understand what you&#39;re upset about and anything that you want help on, I want to make better moving forward, not just for the minute. And this is not an argument. But... and this wasn&#39;t even... this wasn&#39;t even like a planned talk. I just thought we could talk about inner structure. And these are issues that we have. No finger pointing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Most of the issues are we don&#39;t have our shit together because we&#39;re running and doing all these other things instead of doing our normal jobs. And then you can&#39;t get your answers to do your job. So I have ways to do this. I&#39;m... let me put it together so it is a complete thought. And all I got to do is just pull the trigger on it, after we talk about it..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />... because I would like to hear your thoughts, what you would like to add, because you&#39;re on the other side. This is a completely amicable conversation. No attacking at all. I just think we need a couple things and I over the phone talking like this is never easy. I don&#39;t.... And I get it.</p><p><strong>main reason for job pileup. LG and SG say one thing and do another, goods dont arrive, but then we are held to same schedule. very hard on team. 2 of our best employees resigned stating same remarks</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No one&#39;s attacking anyone, but for you to get your answers, I want to get them faster. And it&#39;s not even about answers. It&#39;s just when the way jobs move through are hindered, we got to move that blockage. And yes, it&#39;s more work up front to do that, but it is the intelligent thing to do and we&#39;ll be happier on the other side.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not asking for anything extra from you. I&#39;m just talking to you about the structure of our place. And I mean, there&#39;s no feelings in the structure of our place. The structure is the structure. And if we look at it and you say it&#39;s fine, okay, well, then how do we fix these x-y-z problems? Okay, well, then let&#39;s try this. Let&#39;s try this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I might be completely wrong on what I think we need. All we got to do is talk, and it&#39;s not an argument. And if you&#39;re busy right now and frustrated from other things, just say so and I&#39;ll just patch it together and we could come back to it when things calm down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But there may be a couple, you know, this, that and the other thing that we might need in the in the meantime, being one of these two people that were interviewing, maybe that might make things better. And then we kick the can down the road on something else. I mean, these are I&#39;m not asking for I&#39;m not giving you due dates or anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t.. I don&#39;t know what I could do to be more professional or I mean, I&#39;m trying to paint this in the nicest picture.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I still don&#39;t have any clarity on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. So, so, so, Luke, you want me to just tell you all the pieces and why right now? It&#39;s complex. </p><p><strong>All 484 texts between 03/07-03/10 say everything about working with LG
