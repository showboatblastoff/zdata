JZ calls out LG ordering overseas for his Wifes Employer Constellation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />But to also kind of like look at, you know, I mean obviously there&#39;s going to be a lot of things that are like, you know, garments. And I was, you know, moving those things to garments and various apparel and things like that.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />But like to look at, you know, the difference between, like, embroidery, whether that is contract decoration or if you&#39;re doing embroidery in-house and, like, things like that, like, I just don&#39;t I&#39;m not quite sure about that because it&#39;s, you know, you guys know better than I do.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>fiduciary, COG</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />But to kind of, you know, start to understand a little bit more what these numbers represent, to be able to kind of, understand where we got to 75% cost of goods.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>fiduciary, COG</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Like what? What happened?
</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>fiduciary, COG</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Is it the pricing? Where is the pricing wrong?
</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>fiduciary, COG, outsource</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Is it too... Is there too much to outsource?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>call-out, suzanne, overseas</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There seemed to be, there seemed to be a movement towards making a lot of this branded stuff overseas. And that, I mean...</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>cog, fiduciary, self-serving, suzanne</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I came across so many that were so high priced for, like, Dyson and a couple other places like that where the turnaround, it was like we were paying $40 for the item. And then charging them like $44, you know, and it was like, whoa, that is so high.
</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>north-face</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And same with The North Face stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Hmm. Yeah.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>ripple, lg-plan, self-serving, suzanne</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah, I get it. But it&#39;s like we can only charge so much for embroidery. So, you know, I saw a bunch that had these coats that were like, you know, over 100 something dollars each. And we did like $2 of embroidery on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which I, I get you got to take the little jobs with the big jobs. And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s because or we&#39;re taking these jobs, there&#39;s a bigger picture. Like, you know, a lot of people give us garbage, tiny jobs, in order to string us along for the big ones.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>ripple
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And and I get we&#39;re always trying to take as much as we can, but what I&#39;ve been doing over the last two weeks is I&#39;m working on a new platform to try to drive sales from the broader base of... online customers. Sorry. My screen just went off.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got it streamlined. It&#39;s I&#39;m really understanding the APIs and pushing stuff back and forth and scraping the info, and I&#39;ve been running all the queries.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s awesome. I could actually pull up, a sales person, the year and look at how they, they did per customer.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And like, you could put different... it builds like little charts against themselves. But...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />With all this automation and stuff, I think that if we get away from it being sales based, in that someone has to go woo a giant customer to make it monthly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean that that&#39;s a lot of the reason we&#39;re in the trouble we&#39;re in now, which I 1,000% get when someone&#39;s got the money out in front of you, you take it. And well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />That&#39;s not so. That&#39;s kind of the the opposite of what I&#39;m saying. So I, I, I don&#39;t want you to just take anything that walks or strolls by you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, we don&#39;t, we want to get away from that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And the way I think to do that is with this online system where as people find us, that&#39;s more revenue making its way to us in a general way, because that&#39;s the way they find everyone else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not like there&#39;s, you know, Culture has some hotshot guy who goes and recruits every customer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s, you know, just online portals and this and that. And if we have that running in the background, you know, anything big on top of it is just cake.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I have a whole system with that and I got it, I got it now where the emails that come in from Future Shirts automatically turn into an invoice with their exact pricing and everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, and it could API back into their system so we don&#39;t have to play with their their system is goofy. So I&#39;m going to talk to Carmel about plugging into theirs, and it&#39;ll be killer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, I&#39;ve also figured out how to get into the messaging in Printavo. So when you want to message a customer, it goes through the Printavo messaging, bypassing any phone numbers or any of that kind of stuff. And it&#39;s all trackable in the job, like going back. But I mean, I...
</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>ignored, fiduciary, </h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I think by opening more doors to regular revenue that&#39;s not so hard to get will be very helpful.</p><p><strong>jz-sys,  

SM states JZ's automation and analysis data is going to be enormous</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I... yeah, I definitely think that you&#39;re automation work is going to be enormous, and I think that&#39;s the way that everybody&#39;s going towards.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And I think that you should definitely, continue to move forward with the automations and things like that. And, and that&#39;s awesome. Like, I think that that is, definitely the way to go.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And you want to continue to pursue that. But what I want you guys to also take a look at is like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />For those projects where that you mentioned, where it&#39;s like, you know, the North Face jackets, and the embroidery on it. So that would be almost the equivalent of the customer supplying the garments, like you&#39;re not making a markup on the garment</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Or the apparel like, so you would want to start like separating that out into, like customer supplied garment or something to that effect, or even have the customer, you know, their card is charged for the North Face stuff, since it&#39;s such a pass through to you in terms of profitability.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And so it&#39;s things like that where you&#39;re like, okay, so if we if, if the cost for, the North Face jackets and the, you know, the resale price for them are basically just a pass through and we&#39;re not making any money on this, this aspect of it.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />We&#39;re going to look at this, you know, revenue stream. As you know, the goods are supplied by the, the client and it&#39;s just the in-house embroidery service or whatever.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So what is that like, how much money are we making on that? How, um, lean are we running on that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Spark employee overheard: </strong><br />What&#39;s the production turnaround time like the cost for that? Is it, you know, outsource whatever. And then that&#39;s how you lean into the profitability of that job was because the Colas are a pass through like right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />The garment, it&#39;s not even there. And you could actually have your client. You could be like, here&#39;s, we need your card...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />North Face is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You&#39;re paying for this. We&#39;re not covering the cost of it because it&#39;s basically a pass through. So something like that. And then, you know,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />As you drill into the details of the different revenue streams, you know, like the those types of, garments supplied by clients, like for the sake of this conversation,  versus, you know, you know, something else that&#39;s really profitable for you guys or something that&#39;s, you know, like live printing and it&#39;s completely different and you really like niche down into those things.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>11-11</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You can look at what your, ideal client looks like and what that looks like from start to finish to really try to understand, you know, what you want from not only these, like, niche, you know, revenue streams within the company, but who is a good fit for you guys and, and who isn&#39;t.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>11-11</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And sometimes that will, you know, saying no is, a fiscally responsible thing to do sometimes because if it if it doesn&#39;t, like, make money, it can be losing money and it can be taking you from, you know, that ideal or dream client.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>11-11</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And that&#39;s like an exercise that, you know, we have all of our clients do is like, you know, coming up with your dream, you know, job, per niche and client, and you can&#39;t always have that.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>11-11</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />But it&#39;s a good thing to try to strive for and kind of keep in mind, because if you have someone who&#39;s so, like, against what you&#39;re going for, then maybe that is the moment to be like, you know what?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>11-11</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />We&#39;re not aligned. But I can give you my competitor who I don&#39;t like number, and deal with them.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>11-11</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I do that here and there.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the worldâ€™s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-m4a-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your m4a files to text">Automatically convert your m4a files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="upload many different filetypes" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/list-of-languages-and-filetypes?utm_source=embed">upload many different filetypes</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="powerful integrations and APIs" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/integrations?utm_source=embed">powerful integrations and APIs</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automated subtitles" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/automated-subtitles?utm_source=embed">automated subtitles</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="collaboration tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/collaborate-with-teams?utm_source=embed">collaboration tools</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
