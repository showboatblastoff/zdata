I didn&#39;t need you to take that on because I never decided to specifically take that on for myself. And I have a rebuttal for all of those points that is unnecessary in the first place.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Wait, wait. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m trying to understand what you&#39;re saying. What&#39;s unnecessary? Your replies or what I said was unnecessary?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There was never a decision for me, not only by myself or mutually, to take on all sales for myself whatsoever. We were also and still in a position...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Again, the way you&#39;re coming back is it seems personal, like you didn&#39;t... I wasn&#39;t getting through what I was trying to get through. There&#39;s there&#39;s no blame. There&#39;s... you understand there&#39;s zero blame, right? Do you think I&#39;m blaming you? Just before we go down this road, I want to know if you feel like I am blaming you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think you&#39;re blaming me, but I don&#39;t think that you&#39;re seeing the other portion of the side of it that it doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s blame or not blame, but there&#39;s a lot more pieces to that part of the conversation that... that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s unnecessary to go down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. I understand. But... What? So you&#39;re just saying you... what? You you&#39;re stopping today?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m stopping today, but I&#39;m saying that I don&#39;t think that... I&#39;m not... I&#39;m not happy with the structure of this business. I&#39;ve haven&#39;t been happy with the structure of it. I&#39;m not happy with the division of anything or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What what do you mean by the structure? I&#39;m trying to understand what you&#39;re saying. I hope you don&#39;t feel like I am pointing fingers. I&#39;m just... I want to be on the same page as you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think the... the structure of the workload. I think the structure of the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which let&#39;s... let&#39;s go one by one. What do you think the structure of the workload is?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think there&#39;s way too many things that are on my shoulders at all, at all times. And I think that that&#39;s where certainly a portion of the stress and anxiety comes from. And that&#39;s fine. I can shoulder that in in a position, but I think there&#39;s also then all the ancillary things that come with that that are...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, am I not doing everything I can to help you with every one of these issues?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, in what regard? I mean, that&#39;s a that&#39;s a bigger conversation too. You helping me with things. Yes, is helping me with things, but it doesn&#39;t... it doesn&#39;t just happen and it doesn&#39;t just go away and be fixed. And that&#39;s all of the things that is the same, that have been the same feelings for 7 to 10 years of my life being involved in this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So, I mean, I think that&#39;s a very... that&#39;s just a reality of what my feeling is, and I don&#39;t think that those... that that that conversation alone, I don&#39;t think is something that we&#39;re capable of having because I&#39;ve tried to have that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which conversation?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That I&#39;m not happy with workload. I&#39;m not happy with the structure of the business. I&#39;m not happy...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I understand that, but the way that you could get happy about the workload would be to work with me to help alleviate your workload. I&#39;m not... do you think I&#39;m saying &quot;Hey, not my problem? Everything on this side of this wall is Lucas&#39;s problem?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s zero things that I ever say is your problem. Everything is our problem. And I try to build full systems. I try to hear you at every moment and try to build full systems to try to make things easier... for the workload that just exists in general for powering Rowboat. It&#39;s not me helping Lucas Guariglia. It&#39;s me helping the person in your role at every point. I&#39;m... I am trying to... I mean I sort of feel like, for you to be upset and to be drawing.... First of all, I guess I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re upset and I feel like you&#39;re... there&#39;s some sort of line being drawn, but I feel like you&#39;re drawing that line in front of the wrong person because I&#39;m standing on the side with you trying to assist.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. But I feel line or no line that that&#39;s something that is just irreconcilable and that... that&#39;s a line that we either...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Whats irreconcilable?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s no... I don&#39;t see a way to fix it. I don&#39;t see...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Fix... When you say it... and I just want to make sure we&#39;re talking about the same things. You don&#39;t see a way to fix the workload?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I don&#39;t see a way to fix our decisions on the the workload between both of us. I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a way to work through the current structure of a business right now that for since the beginning of time of that was a 5050 partnership. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m capable of working through not only just all of the things in the history that we have that have happened time and time again. I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m capable of being hopeful that things will change in the future. I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m capable of being in a position where things won&#39;t happen again that can be and or have been not only detrimental to the business for both of our sakes, but also for any part of my future in the future. And I just can&#39;t I just can&#39;t be there anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That... that&#39;s fine. Okay is the answer. But, there&#39;s a reality to how we make whatever you&#39;re trying to say happen that needs to be handled. It can&#39;t be... I... I can&#39;t write on someone&#39;s check &quot;Luke can&#39;t do this anymore.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We have to come up with a plan before we really, really screw ourselves.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I understand that. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m... that&#39;s why I said even in my text that beyond taking time to think of what this is, that we are not capable of having those conversations and coming to those decisions without...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />When you say we. When you say we, please don&#39;t speak for me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I am not capable. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m capable.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know you are having you are. We&#39;re doing it now. You are capable.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right, but I don&#39;t think that for the productiveness and for as quickly as things need to happen, that things will happen.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s a future that you&#39;re predicting that doesn&#39;t have to be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Maybe so, but I mean, I&#39;m going off of again, just it&#39;s not for the dramatic effect, but if you had somebody for X, Y, Z amount of years feeling the same way, and having...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Hey...I want you to feel good. I want you to be happy. I&#39;m not... am I saying stay here or any sort of argument at all? I hear you and I&#39;m sorry you feel that way. Anything I could do to help, I will. Now, where does this leave the S&amp;S? What are you going to tell them?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t, I mean.... My next steps of where... and that&#39;s why I feel like having the conversation was having the conversation, because I feel like the next steps of this just has to be with our own individual people involved and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. Good. Yes. Tell me the dates and we&#39;ll figure it out. But I mean, I feel like I am trying to get to some action items or any of that stuff because... right now, the floor needs a lot of stuff from me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, but the action items are... and this is... there&#39;s never an opportune time to have the conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. Well, then here, let me... They&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t need to go for another two hours. All I think... all my intentions were is to have a conversation and say that I felt like it would be more respectful... for you again, whether you feel like I&#39;ve said the same thing a million times or here we are having the same conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s just how I&#39;m wrapping things up. This isn&#39;t I&#39;ve heard this a thousand times, it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But but you have.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But, but what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;ve heard you every time... and I feel like every time that I&#39;ve heard you, you feel it....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t do anything about it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You feel it didn&#39;t have the effect that you wanted. So if you are able to tell me what the effect is that you want, I&#39;ll be happy to... because I mean, we&#39;re talking I... Do you need me to...? And I&#39;m fine if you want to do the the lawyer stuff. I&#39;ll get... I&#39;ll talk to my lawyer if you want to do whatever the answer is Yes. If you want, you want to. Just keep working right now, I&#39;ll stay on the phone. I&#39;ll stay on here and start do a PowerPoint presentation with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean yes to all of those things. Is the option even there for either of us to stop working? No. Is that its own prison in itself? Yes. But my next steps are.. yes... trying to continue with that. What I didn&#39;t want it to be is saying, okay, the next thing that you&#39;re hearing, we have these conversations and then you&#39;re receiving a legal letter without our conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. And if you do that, that&#39;s fine. I just... we still have other stuff we got to do. I mean, make that stuff happen and we&#39;ll just see where it goes. It is what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, I. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean. What..what are you... I respect what you&#39;re saying. Isn&#39;t that the ultimate outcome or the, you know, the outcome that would be wanted for a healthy business relationship?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I guess so. I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. And I just think it&#39;s unfortunate that it seems to be what the situation is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And it&#39;s really... it&#39;s different for me because I&#39;m in... I think maybe I&#39;m in a different position... situation than you are. But I don&#39;t... besides the bringing up of this kind of stuff. I don&#39;t have... I mean, there literally is zero issues. I&#39;m here to work. I don&#39;t... We see each other once in a while. I mean, can&#39;t we just work? And move forward with everything you said? Yes?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, yes. All of those things have to happen, period. Right. But I don&#39;t there&#39;s no way to have this conversation. I mean, even if I were to tell you now, what&#39;s the... what&#39;s the situation? It&#39;s either I would like to leave or I would like you to leave. You think we&#39;re capable of having that conversation?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yes, 1,000%. You think I&#39;m going to argue to stay in...? No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />(sarcasticly)&quot;You&#39;re going to work with me, Lucas!&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I would never do that. Of course you tell me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Every time I had a conversation with you seven years ago where I said the same thing and said.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But we&#39;re right now, let&#39;s talk about right now we&#39;re different people. Why don&#39;t we talk about right now?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m saying don&#39;t worry about remember this time back then and this and remember that. There&#39;s now and I&#39;m right here, right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. It&#39;s the same thing that has regardless of time, I do not feel like the division of labor is equal. I do not feel that for quite some time...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Is that... do you say that the division of labor is like my fault?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anybody&#39;s fault. I think it&#39;s just been what it is then what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, why don&#39;t we just fix the amount of work that goes to you? Isn&#39;t that the answer?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, because I don&#39;t think... It doesn&#39;t change. It doesn&#39;t change, because it wouldn&#39;t be that any of those... any of those... roles, any of those responsibilities, they would never change and they will never change. It doesn&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We are the owners. We could do whatever we want. You can say you could come up with some outrageous plan of the way sales works now, and that is how it works. If it works, it works. I mean, there&#39;s no one stopping anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re talking about division of labor. Do less labor. How do I make that module work? No one&#39;s stopping you. No one is kicking all the work over there and closing the door and saying, &quot;This is Lucas&#39;s&quot;?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So, I mean, this is like:

(JZ roleplaying a fictitious sarcastic scene where JZ and LG roles are reversed):
&quot;Lucas. I got too many emails. I can&#39;t do this anymore.&quot;

You could say &quot;I&#39;m not the one sending the emails!&quot;

But I&#39;m like:
&quot;It doesn&#39;t change the problem. I have too many emails.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s not an issue. The issue is you have too much work. And you feel like you could be doing other stuff. And I&#39;m not saying other stuff as in going out shopping and hanging out. I mean, other stuff to move the business on or personal.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, it&#39;s... this argument is with yourself. I mean, if there&#39;s too much work, then don&#39;t do it. And then we&#39;ll just figure out how to make that work because those pieces need to be done.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s why I mean, when you were here, I don&#39;t know if you notice, but the entire time I&#39;m trying to remove work from you permanently. Literally, I&#39;ve made it for, like, the last couple of months trying to make this take all work off Lucas&#39;s table. And, I mean, and if you don&#39;t see that, it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of upsetting. But you have to acknowledge that I, I&#39;ve been trying, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And so then then then this, this conversation is not with me. This is with yourself. And I&#39;m not being rude. It really is. Because everything you&#39;re saying is like. I&#39;m like, &quot;okay, but that&#39;s not anything that I&#39;m doing&quot;. If anything, okay, let&#39;s let&#39;s fix that. How much....? What can I take off your plate? And I&#39;m... I&#39;ve already tried to do it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got the I already built a thing that I could just send out to the next customer that makes you permanently never even see a file, ever, and make it so you never have to answer an email about it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I even pitched to you yesterday... Friday about making orders that literally just have notes in the customer notes and someone else puts it together. I mean, so for you to say that the division of labor is not fair, it it&#39;s as fair as you let it be. I&#39;m trying to...

I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re... It&#39;s not like...  don&#39;t take it like:

(JZ mimics a stereotypical stern voice for demonstration):
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing over there!&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing, because if I could, I would say, why don&#39;t we consolidate this? You&#39;re doing this way too much. Why don&#39;t you give this to me and we&#39;ll figure out how to get that done here, which is literally the only thing I try to ever do. So I&#39;m able to have any conversation you want. You tell me you want me to leave.. You can tell me you want me to leave, but I would write down on a piece of paper the reasons that you really think it is that you want me to leave. Because I think you&#39;d be surprised.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. I&#39;m, I&#39;m aware. And I think part of that is not only given the actual legal structure of this, that I cannot that that&#39;s not a conversation. I can&#39;t just say X, Y and Z has happened X, Y, and Z continues to happen. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because I know that&#39;s... that would be... you need, you know, stuff to back it up. Yes, that is true. And that is... I&#39;m sorry that if you can&#39;t find anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If you can&#39;t find anything, what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />To have a reason to have me not here. I mean... this is... I mean, this is interesting to me but, not very shocking.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think it should be shocking. And I don&#39;t and I&#39;m not trying to have it be shocking. And I don&#39;t think... that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying this is where the conversation gets to a point of you&#39;re not... either you&#39;re not aware of it or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, I&#39;m listening. You said you&#39;re saying it&#39;s workload. And then what was my answer? It was, How do we make your workload better? Like I always ask you. So, I mean, how is that an argument with me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Workload is one of many, many things. I mean, that&#39;s one aspect of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then let&#39;s talk about another one. I mean, there&#39;s nothing that I&#39;m fighting you on. So, I mean, if you have issues, I want to make them better for you, even if it&#39;s just in the transition. I mean, we still have stuff to do. And I want to work here..... I want to continue to keep working with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t care if you if you say, &quot;hey, you know what? You&#39;re right. Let&#39;s forget this whole conversation. It looks like we&#39;re doing some stuff.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t need a ten year, you know, commitment on anything. I just need to be able to continue doing what we&#39;ve always been doing. And if, you know...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, but that doesn&#39;t work for me and that can&#39;t work for me anymore. Okay? Beyond the fact of me physically dying. I can&#39;t..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay... The answer is yes. Am I saying no to anything? Okay. I mean, I said my part. Well, you say your part and your part is.... I don&#39;t.... honestly, I&#39;m not really following. There is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But my part becomes... here&#39;s the problems. Okay, cool. What is the solve? Me coming up with just what the solve is?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, well, well all of this is.... You just fabricated all that. There is no issue that was brought up. When I say &quot;bring up the issue&quot;, you tell me what the issue is. And then when we actually look at the issue, you say, &quot;well, let&#39;s look at a different issue&quot;. So what&#39;s another one? There&#39;s no other issues that I&#39;m trying to argue with you on at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m completely susceptible to whatever you decide to do, however you decide to act.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And so are we talking about the bank?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s that&#39;s again, one of many things. And that to me was the last thing that as the more and more that I figure out the situation that how detrimental and potentially detrimental that is to me not only business wise but also for me personally.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So this is being put on me? The bank is being put on me? 100%?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, one, yes. But also that&#39;s one of several instances.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s why I said also that I don&#39;t see those things changing in the future. There&#39;s no protection for me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not fighting you on anything. I don&#39;t know why it goes this way. I understand. So what do we do? So what do we do?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s not a decision or a solve that you or I can make. That is a decision for somebody to legally say &quot;Okay, that&#39;s fine. Heres the situation....&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So, I mean, like like when you said the next step should involve lawyers and I said yes? Why are we still... I mean, there&#39;s no argument. That&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s have that conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I felt that I was doing the respectful thing and having that conversation or attempting to. But if it keeps going to, that&#39;s fine. Then we&#39;ll just talk to lawyers. Then it becomes okay. That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I mean, you and I are trying to have the conversation. You say what the problem is and then we talk about it. Then you say, well, no, let&#39;s talk about a different problem. So I&#39;m literally I haven&#39;t heard anything that we could talk about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />We just went through two. There&#39;s two right there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, and you said workload. And what was my answer? &quot;Fuck you?&quot; 

Was that my answer or was it... &quot;Hey, I&#39;m... I...&quot;

Can we agree that I&#39;ve been trying to make it better and I will continue to?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean. Well, I mean, that&#39;s one conversation that we talked about and that went well. I mean, did something.. If you.. if you would like to revisit that and there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d like me to be made aware of, I&#39;m all ears.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t... I think workload is the lowest on the totem pole. That&#39;s something else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then what&#39;s... then what&#39;s... I mean, well, then we solve that one because we&#39;ll just get rid of the work that you&#39;re doing, so there&#39;s less and we&#39;ll get there. What else is there?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s that&#39;s. That&#39;s fine. But in the grand scheme of things, the &quot;we&#39;ll get there&quot;, while I understand and absolutely respect that you&#39;re trying to do that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We could start it... well we could start right now. I mean... I mean if you think that we&#39;ll never start it, I&#39;ll bring out a piece of paper right now and start writing down whatever. I mean...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just don&#39;t think that... I think the current solve for what that is for the time involved is not... that&#39;s fine but that just becomes something that in... it doesn&#39;t happen. It doesn&#39;t happen effectively. It doesn&#39;t happen not only quick enough and it&#39;s just not the... it&#39;s an idea of a solve.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Going down a path of saying, &quot;okay, well, we don&#39;t need you to be doing those sorts of things. It&#39;s just going to be all AI generated stuff&quot;, that&#39;s great, but that&#39;s just not a solve for right now, and that&#39;s not something that happens right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. What is the solve for the money?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is no solve. There is generate more sales. The way that I had to do all of last week to try to pound to get all of the money in there to do they only solve is to continue to do all of that which I&#39;m absolutely capable of, but at a certain point there&#39;s only so much that you can try or attempt to do around the clock. And when it doesn&#39;t happen, it just doesn&#39;t happen. So what is the other solve of that is the alternative that I opened up with, saying at a certain point it&#39;s going to be time to start laying people off and when that happens, then that&#39;s a different bridge to cross and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Depending where the rest of the conversations go and trying to figure out that if that conversation just becomes &quot;okay, that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s we&#39;re working towards&quot; it&#39;s not something overnight. If we&#39;re working towards dissolving the partnership as it stands and closing the business, then that&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t happen overnight as well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right. So we we should have an idea of what we&#39;re going to... If if we&#39;re going to close the doors, there should be a don&#39;t buy any more stuff clause so we don&#39;t dig the hole deeper. Right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m... I&#39;m aware of that. Yes. Part of that is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Please don&#39;t... I&#39;m not attacking you, I&#39;m just saying these are things that will need to be happen, that will need to happen. And we will both be less happy if we did it wrong and wound up in the hole worse. So literally, I&#39;m here to say yes to everything and to make it work both in the interim and however else it turns out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, but that doesn&#39;t. Then all I hear is, &quot;okay, figure out what that is and I&#39;ll say yes to that.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s where the conversation... if we were to have a real conversation, we would say, what are the steps to make this happen? Okay, I&#39;ll take this step. You take that step. I&#39;m 1,000% capable of it. I&#39;ll do it right now with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know where else things can....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know you can&#39;t describe what the issue is. I try to help you with that issue and then you want to move on because there&#39;s so many issues. And this is all about how we can&#39;t have a conversation. We&#39;re talking the issues seem to just disappear.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />How are they how are they disappearing? We just regardless... We&#39;re not talking about workload anymore. Thats not an issue.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Let&#39;s make let&#39;s make a Google sheet and I&#39;ll go down the line and we can put I mean, because that&#39;s how it is. There&#39;s facts. If a fact is you have too much work, then the answer is, how do we make... we come up with a way to make it less. And there still will be work. I mean, if we just say we&#39;re closing today, there&#39;s still work that needs to be done. The whole rest of the day and the whole next day and this and that and the other thing. And we got to go down the line x-ing those off. Otherwise we&#39;re going to bury ourselves.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So, I mean, let&#39;s make a list. I mean, I don&#39;t want you to say that I&#39;ve never tried to hear you on this stuff because I 1,000% have. And I would like to continue to do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And by me doing this isn&#39;t some trick to make you to stay and work with me forever. This is interim... I don&#39;t want you to be unhappy, like, as always. And yes, I hear my voice. It&#39;s sounding sarcastic. But it&#39;s not meant to be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So what are we doing?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Hold on. I just need a second. What?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Hmm. Sorry. Just give me one. What the hell is going on here? Drive won&#39;t let me log in. Okay. Try again. Here we go.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Let me share this with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So under workload we could put what other different things that... So there is the Instagram. You handle the Instagram stuff? That&#39;s a daily thing. We built a Flickr.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t... mean to cut down on that, but I don&#39;t want to get hung up on workload. That&#39;s kind of...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just putting what we&#39;ve already talked about. So then what&#39;s another one?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think liability. There&#39;s nothing not only legally that protects me, there&#39;s nothing. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There is. We have LLC, but... I don&#39;t... What are you talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s not. Because part of the other part of the bank situation is the fact that that has potential to now be reported to other banks, which I don&#39;t care about on the Rowboat side of that, but for any future endeavors of me that I cannot be attached to anything like that. And if that has...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not following.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />&quot;Anything like that?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />A bank account is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m literally just trying to have you specify what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s like business credit. So if that&#39;s in a permanent file, then any sort of relationship that I continue to build outside of Rowboat that is saying, okay, that&#39;s fine, I&#39;d like to open a business account with whoever.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t are you saying you don&#39;t want to be on a bank account with me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m just using that as an example of the current most recent bank situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which is turning out to be fraud. But let&#39;s carry on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. There&#39;s... It doesn&#39;t matter. The... the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It does matter. It does matter. So if you&#39;re mad at me for shooting someone and it turns out I&#39;d never shot them, could you still be mad at me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, but you are...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But it&#39;s always something? Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, it is. And you are half of the business that is a reflection of half of the business. And there is nothing to insulate me from that and or beyond...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Fine, I mean until.. Then we can&#39;t be in a business together because you think I&#39;m a liability, which is fine then. I mean, there&#39;s nothing to argue about. So there&#39;s the liability issue. Then what else is there? I mean, because that&#39;s irreconcilable and I don&#39;t really understand, but. Okay. What else is there besides the liability?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t understand how you couldn&#39;t understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What&#39;s that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Think thats there.. I don&#39;t understand how you couldn&#39;t understand that if I was. I&#39;m the complete flip side of that. You don&#39;t think that would be in question on you or anybody else? Or if there was a third party?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, I want the third party here because there&#39;s a reality to this conversation. We need it. Our lack of any one.. Any accountability for anything you say has what led us to where we are and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br /> Any accountability? Are you saying that I can&#39;t support you being a liability?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah. Yes, definitely.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Here. You&#39;re in court. Say something that shows I did anything of any malice or did anything that has ever had any effect on the business. I mean, that would be, you know, not &quot;I remember this time and you&#39;re always dot, dot, dot.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, I don&#39;t feel the need to go down the list of them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, but, I&#39;m just saying, you if you could even just come up with one, I&#39;d be happy.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The most recent one is that the Chicago Bears choose to not proceed with a relationship with us. Given the interaction at the last activation that we talked about that you said was not the case. There was an altercation on company grounds with a gangbanger that we talked about when resulted from.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />When was that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t I could Sure, I could find the date and a list of them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are you talking... What are you talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You had an altercation again with somebody over a parking spot that Mike had to specifically tell them, along with another person, to stop driving to our company grounds. That not only is liability to the business, but also to the safety of people in the business.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s not true. This is the first I&#39;m hearing of this but okay, that&#39;s fine. I mean, we could but I mean, it all falls apart because let&#39;s get Mike and please do pull up that date because I&#39;d like to see what you&#39;re talking about. Because if you&#39;re talking about the time that Rachel actually had to call Mike to tell the people upstairs to completely stay out of my parking spot because I only called and did not want to have anything to do with it because of how I get questioned about something the way it didn&#39;t happen. But then when it&#39;s proved, even with video and everything, you just got to move on. But so, I mean, let&#39;s talk about that, because there was no altercation with any gangbangers. There was months ago someone who parked and lived upstairs. And then they said when I when I called Mike, they know I got it all, but it&#39;s fine. So there&#39;s that one. Actually, what we should do is you should just tell me all those things. And then there&#39;s literally documented evidence of everything because of how I&#39;m blamed for everything. I document everything. I record all our phone calls or I record some. And then I also keep all the texts and everything because the issues you bring up don&#39;t line up with the reality of things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, because it&#39;s never you. You&#39;re very seldomly have I ever, along with the bank situation that it&#39;s always something else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So. So I did not get flagged for fraud literally the day before. Are you saying that I fabricated that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It has absolutely nothing to do with the situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Nothing to do with it? Despite that, in the recorded phone calls that I have from early warning that, say, a bank, once seeing that someone has been flagged for fraud, will close down your accounts.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What does that matter? </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I have it. I have it recorded. I mean, but then again,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What does that have anything to do with their multiple situations and records of altercations within a bank branch?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And then I would love for you to hear what the altercations are. I have one recorded. You&#39;re welcome to hear that. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Why does it mean..it mean anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Again. Again, again, again. So that&#39;s one thing. Liability. What else do we have?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, there&#39;s I don&#39;t want to continue working with you if it&#39;s like this, but no one&#39;s forcing you to stay working with me. But what are we going to do about our bills? Nothing?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because if the answer is nothing, then I got to do something on my end here.. not.. to to save, to make.. to get money coming in here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, isn&#39;t that our job to keep the business running?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, And that has been the job. And that&#39;s been the stress of the job for the last two weeks as I&#39;ve continued to do that. This is where the conversation goes, and this is where...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know... It&#39;s me listening and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s you being. It&#39;s it&#39;s you being you and it&#39;s it&#39;s every part of why don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t care about this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t need to turn over this will never go to a Supreme Court. It has nothing to do with saying okay great show your evidence.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not fighting you on anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re interrupting me is what you continue to do too..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I apologize.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...and every step of the way. If a partner on the other side of it says, I see you as a liability to the business, I have no insulation to that. I don&#39;t want any any interaction with that affecting not only the business that I&#39;m currently in and or any future businesses.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is no action for that right now. That is a legal thing that has to be taken care of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p><strong>LG states wants more ownership of RBC 5 days after account closed and new ones opened without JZ name on them</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Beyond the workload, which is nothing beyond dividing up things and trying to I&#39;m not concerned about that. Workload is workload. The value I think of our positions has been skewed and that is a conversation that I&#39;ve had multiple times with you. And whether wanna say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Skewed?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...you want to say bring up the past, whether you want</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, we&#39;re 50/50.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are saying you should be paid more than me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not only does it result to the the payment amount, I think that the equity alone, based on the value of the business, should be different. And I think that the structure of the business should be different no matter what, because that is also when more decisions unrelated to having a 50/50 conversation that never, never goes anywhere because we can never agree on anything that that&#39;s a conversation that I specifically did try to have seven years ago. And your response was, Fuck you, you can have it all. And that&#39;s where that conversation stopped. And so, yes, there&#39;s continued resentment that has built from that from a long time ago. That is still the situation. And I put it under the rug for a long time thinking things will get better. But it hasn&#39;t gotten better. And I think that that&#39;s a very valid conversation to have with any sort of partnership, regardless of one person, two people or five people. Okay. And I and again, I think that that&#39;s not a conversation that we&#39;re capable of because I&#39;ve tried to have it multiple conversations and it hasn&#39;t worked.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry. Hang on. There&#39;s... a train went by. Sorry. I couldn&#39;t hear you. All right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So I&#39;m assuming that your position is still the same position and you don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which is? Which is what? My answer was. I said, I&#39;m saying yes to anything. Everything is yes. So, I mean, I have zero position. My position is to make every day better. That&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m trying to do. And if.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes is not a is not an answer to that, nor was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not fighting you on anything. So if you say, let&#39;s talk to lawyers, let&#39;s get the lawyers, then they&#39;ll tell us what the next steps are. I don&#39;t even know what else to do besides that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If that was the one issue that we turned over to them, they are going to say, okay, so what... That conversation</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know and that&#39;s where I&#39;m... I mean, because this is on your end. I mean, how do we make whatever you want happen happen?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s a conversation that either happens or it doesn&#39;t happen because I tried to have it seven years ago and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I said, let&#39;s have it now. And there&#39;s there&#39;s no conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You feel like that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Please don&#39;t tell me what I feel. Please don&#39;t tell me what I feel or what you think.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m asking you. That was the beginning of a question before you interrupted me. You feel like that&#39;s unfounded?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Feel like what is unfounded?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You feel like me saying that the current structure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m saying I&#39;m listening to you. But if you feel that what we do is not 50/50, I... that... I disagree. I mean, I feel like we we both put in what we both put in. And I mean, I feel like we I&#39;m not saying either one of us is doing more. I&#39;m saying both of us are providing very important functions here. And I&#39;m not sitting here and valuing anything saying this part is mine, this part is his. I&#39;m not even sure what we&#39;re even talking..... A percentage of zero is zero. I mean. I mean, like we&#39;re talking about the structure of a business that we can&#39;t even tell you for what we&#39;re going to do about paying the bills. I mean that&#39;s pointless. But I mean, if you if you&#39;re saying to me that you would like to acquire more of Rowboat, then that is upsetting because I&#39;ve never had a &quot;you and me&quot; in my mind, like a &quot;you or me&quot;. It was &quot;us&quot;. And I get it. I hear you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. But hearing me doesn&#39;t push that conversation forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It does. I mean, it does. We said we&#39;re... I have a lawyer. I mean, do you have one? Do you want me to set up an appointment? I will.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So short of that next step, that&#39;s... that&#39;s a conversation that we&#39;re incapable of, of having?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re the only one saying that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m... we&#39;re having it right now. Whether this isn&#39;t leaving here with a solve for something. I wasn&#39;t anticipating that. But I&#39;m saying that yes that&#39;s that is on however you want to put it on the list that that is it is a concern and it has been a concern.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, you just told me your thoughts. I heard them. I hear you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, if you want more of the business, I wouldn&#39;t grant you that. And I do think it would be time to... unfortunately, I mean, that only leaves one answer. When one person is unhappy and wants out and the job... the business takes both of us, then it&#39;s got to go. And it is what it is. I&#39;m not going to fight you on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What has to go?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The business.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s... that&#39;s... that&#39;s your solve?</p><p><strong>LG confirms the business will not continue unless given more ownership, after taking control of bank accounts</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, no, I mean, that&#39;s not a solve. If if I&#39;m hearing you correct, then if it doesn&#39;t happen, then what? We... The business doesn&#39;t go on, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, if you&#39;re asking for more of rowboat than 50%. I mean, we would have to just dissolve it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, so your answer is no?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, no to what? I mean... I mean... what... dude, I&#39;m so confused. Here... I&#39;m not... I really am. I&#39;m not arguing with you. I really am trying to hear you and really am trying to answer the question. Am I answering the wrong question?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, but you&#39;re answering the question. And what you&#39;re saying. The conversation is that if I&#39;m unhappy with the equity structure of the company and you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s 50/50 or it&#39;s zero, that answer to me is.</p><p><strong>JZ confirms LG is saying that business does not go on if JZ does not give up more ownership</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no. My question to you was, if you want more than 50%, is that the case?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. Well, that&#39;s not a structure I&#39;m comfortable with. So does it just continue being 50/50 or does it just go away? I mean, it&#39;s up to you then, because you&#39;re the one with the issue. I&#39;m not asking for more. That is you. So if I&#39;m... if I say I don&#39;t like that, ...then whatever happens afterwards is determined by you because the whole issue was brought up by you. And we are still currently 50/50 and so...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And so, don&#39;t say &quot;He said no&quot;. I didn&#39;t say no to anything in the over... trying to overtake Rowboat which... I&#39;m kind of upset with. I mean, I can&#39;t believe you would say that. I would... I mean...</p><p><strong>LG confirms that he has been doing same minimal work for last 7 years because JZ wouldn't give up ownership then.</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You couldn&#39;t believe that I had said that seven years ago. You couldn&#39;t believe that probably five years before that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I know. Still can&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what to tell you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How do you. How do you feel... What leads you to not only have that thought, but to say that out loud to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How do you feel that you deserve more than 50?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think that it&#39;s a part of it is is positioned as to workload. I think part of it...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean if. If we are trying to get workload off you and you say no. Who&#39;s fault is that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not saying no. I&#39;m saying that that wasn&#39;t a main driver to that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />One second, please. Come in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Filiberto: </strong><br />And now for the second file for the balloon. This is the first one, one is missing the Nonpoint at the bottom. Yeah. Yeah. So now it&#39;s more dark.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t bother me. Yeah, because it&#39;s going to go on to discharge and. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Filiberto: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it looks great.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Filiberto: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p><strong>JZ points out LG saying workload is main issue, then not an issue at all, then again an issue.</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry. I mean... in the end, I don&#39;t know what I could do here. I mean, I get on here saying my answer is yes to everything. I want to make this work. You say it&#39;s about workload, which is something we&#39;ve been breaking down for a long time. We talk about it, then you say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Workload is workload.&quot; Then we come back and you say, &quot;Well, because of workload, I deserve more than 50%.&quot; Is that..... there&#39;s... there&#39;s a hole there that is pretty clear. But because it&#39;s only you and me, this video, whatever you&#39;re recording makes no difference because you&#39;re the only one holding yourself responsible to anything.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>LG points out why he doesn't agree with 50/50
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />100%. And I mean, that&#39;s also the worst part about having a 50% business and the two partner business is the fact that there is nobody else to be able to say, okay. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />When it&#39;s two people that respect each other and know that the person that they&#39;re talking to is intelligent and remembers things, when you have that mutual respect, you can have that back and forth. But when it becomes a game it is only  completely apparent to an outside viewer. And which is why I would love for us to have the lawyers involved in everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, that&#39;s fine. But what do you think that they&#39;re going to say? They don&#39;t know the history.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know anything. I mean, this is brought up by you. You&#39;re saying, what are you against.. Now against getting the lawyers?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, not at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then I&#39;m confused. You just said, What do you think they will say? Aren&#39;t we supposed to talk to them?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m just saying that in your position and I&#39;m not looking for you to give me a definitive decision right now. But if you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re not in a position, nor will you ever be in a position to say that I would discuss or agree on any structure other than 5050 then that to me...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, see, that&#39;s a completely different conversation. And why does this become:

(JZ mimicking a proclamation) &quot;in no way, shape or form...&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />and if you say, &quot;hey, this guy&#39;s got $10 million, he says, if we each sign on for 2% and and don&#39;t fucking come anywhere near it for the next ten years, do you want to do it?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You think (JZ mimics a goofy voice) &quot;Nope. Remember I said 5050?&quot;

I mean, it&#39;s insulting. I mean, if you&#39;re trying to just get me to say stuff that&#39;s ridiculous,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Im not at all. I&#39;m not and I&#39;m telling you that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You did. You jump to... &quot;You just said never will you ever be happy with anything besides 5050.&quot; And none of those words ever came from my mouth. My mouth said, if you are currently asking me if you&#39;re currently asking me that for more than 50%, the answer would be I&#39;m not happy with that. That is my answer to that one specific question.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. And I respect that. My only question is, so where does it leave the conversation?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. This is you. This is you. You threw..you drew.... This whole thing could be withdrawn by you and move forward by you. I&#39;m here. I&#39;m listening.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I&#39;m just. And the only. I&#39;m not telling you to this to give me an answer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />This whole conversation is bizarre. I mean, because you. You told me what you thought. I said, Okay, let&#39;s do that. Let&#39;s do with the lawyers and everything. And then it&#39;s, &quot;Whoa, what do you want to do?&quot; I, I don&#39;t know. I just agreed. I&#39;m just agreeing with everything you say and in not to.. not to just get you off the phone, but because I can work with you with anyone. And I want to make everything amicable. I mean, I don&#39;t. I have no problems with you, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, but do you understand why I&#39;m just saying that that ... short of you just saying &quot;Cool. No problem. We can agree on whatever structure that you would like or we both agree on.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Short of..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I, the answer is I will never change anything from 50% unless it is a purchase situation or obviously. But if it&#39;s just you and me and no one other no one else involved, then no way, man. No way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. That&#39;s... you&#39;re entitled to that decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, but what if I came to you and said the same thing?

(JZ roleplays with roles reversed)
&quot;I want more than 50%. I&#39;m here in Chicago with all of production. I&#39;m managing all of this. I&#39;m handling all of this. You&#39;re only taking care of yourself. I want more.&quot;

What would your answer be? Go fuck yourself? or sure?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. I feel like I would say if you feel that you&#39;re entitled to that, then that&#39;s a discussion to have. But clearly what you see as my value to the business...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ve said that I feel both our values are equal, which is why I think it should be 50/50. I 1,000% understand: &quot;No Lucas Guariglia, No Rowboat Creative.&quot; I 1,000% understand that. The same way I understand: &quot;No Joe Zangrilli, No Rowboat Creative.&quot;

And did it take a couple of streetwise knuckleheads to push forward whatever this machine is that we built? Yes, it did. And are we here because we&#39;re knuckleheads? Yes, we are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I just never thought I&#39;d see the day where this would happen between two friends.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But we&#39;ve had this conversation before.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, I know. And I was upset then too. So us say having the conversation before doesn&#39;t make it any better. But I mean, you&#39;re entitled to your own thoughts. And I... I mean, I&#39;m not just gonna roll over and do that after I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t expect you to do that, and I wouldn&#39;t expect you to do that, but part of...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then what are you talking about? I mean, is it workload? Is it the amount of the business you own?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All of.. it&#39;s all of... it&#39;s all of them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. So the answer is you don&#39;t want to work with me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t feel like it is a sustainable business and or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay and I get that. So moving the conversation forward, you can&#39;t work with me is what you&#39;re saying.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I find it extremely difficult to work with you. I find it extremely difficult for me to move past what has been past, which is its own work in itself, but also the feelings of feeling that the equity is shifted. I feel like the equity shifted a long time ago and I understand your position. I don&#39;t expect you just to say, cool, whatever you want to do is whatever you want to do, because that&#39;s not the way that those conversations go. I was not looking for...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to.... hear what you&#39;re having to say. It is the fact that I consider what we built &quot;ours&quot;, and I don&#39;t feel either of us is more important or could ever be more important than each other in this situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I would I would agree. However, I would say that moving forward, I don&#39;t... that&#39;s... whether that was moving forward for me seven years ago or moving forward for me now, I feel like that is why I don&#39;t feel comfortable with it. Just as much as you don&#39;t feel comfortable changing it..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it, but then the answer is we got to do something because we&#39;re just racking up more shit. And I&#39;m not saying come up with a date or anything, I&#39;m just saying that&#39;s the next step. But you clearly don&#39;t want to work with me. I&#39;m trying to do everything I can to address the issues, but... I mean, if when we go to address each issue, we say each issue doesn&#39;t matter. But then the issue comes right back as the reason, it...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They all.. they all matter. I&#39;m not saying they don&#39;t matter. I&#39;m saying that they&#39;re all drivers of the larger issue.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, and in the end it all, unless I could change myself into someone else from...  short of being able to do that, what I&#39;m hearing is &quot;goodbye.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t have a solve. I&#39;m just my conversation was saying, Dude, here&#39;s my issues.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I hear.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Here&#39;s issues that I have stomached that keep me up at night for x amount of time.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know of time and what&#39;s upsetting is they keep you up for so many hours, and you can&#39;t put into words what they are and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They are all the things were talking about. This is what were talking about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You won&#39;t let me assist. I know. And so I&#39;m not....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I could. I could.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not arguing with you. I just don&#39;t. I mean, what should we do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not saying that you are?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t... okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m just.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If you have somebody that is saying I have all of these issues and these things greatly, greatly affect me, and you say, Oh, that sucks. Cool. I want to make that better. Some of them are just impossible to make better.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I don&#39;t that sends me in the same.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean. I understand, but it leads us to the same impasse at a road laid out by you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />By me that can only be solved by me because there&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It can be solved by us. And I&#39;m trying to do the list with you and try to go down. Because if there are issues, they can be fixed. And I&#39;m sitting here with the list. And as we started building it, you said, forget that, forget workload. I mean, a liability is not being fixed. So short of of me just saying this isn&#39;t going to be fixed because of reality, then where does that leave us? It just leaves you unable to say what you want to do, which until you figure it out, I&#39;m still the same person who I was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, it it leaves me with nothing to do. It leaves me... so we leave this conversation and I say &quot;Here&#39;s my issues, here&#39;s workload, here&#39;s liability.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Do you want me? Do you want me to fly out there and work on it with you? I will.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, because it&#39;s not. It&#39;s... Here&#39;s workload. Here&#39;s liability. Can liability be fixed? No. I can&#39;t change who you are. I can&#39;t change the circumstances. Can I change the insulation to that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes I can.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How?....  How?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s... that&#39;s... that&#39;s an agreement that whatever that even looks like the same as it would be for if in the next week I decide to become a raging...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Why are you, why are you saying it to me like this? I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about. Like, tell me. It&#39;s like you&#39;re coming at me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Tell you what? I&#39;m telling you how to. How we would solve it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. Well, I&#39;m listening. I&#39;ve never...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It would be the same reciprocal thing if I become a raging alcoholic in the next week and I&#39;m out here doing erratic things that have the ability to affect the business. You should have the same insulation to that to say, look, heres what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But what is what? What is this thing you&#39;re talking about? Is it a document we sign?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, probably.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And isn&#39;t it that just standard practice? Aren&#39;t we already in that with the 50/50?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, because. What do you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just wondering. I&#39;m saying.... No, don&#39;t listen to me.... I&#39;m saying no.... I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s already in play because of things... </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. Its not in play.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />...we&#39;ve already agreed on. It&#39;s not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. I mean, it would be in play to the to the effect that. Yes, sure. Could I bring if it goes to that, I mean, I bring a court case to say, here&#39;s this person, whether it&#39;s you or somebody else, that has caused all of these potential damages to the to the potential business, I want them... They would say, &quot;cool, dissolve the partnership. Move on.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right. Right. And that&#39;s what it sounds like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Correct. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that this conversation was for me to bring up all of those elements and say that is that a document that simply says, hey, if I do X, Y, and Z and it is this, then I have the right as a person to say, okay, well, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even know what it could be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Hold on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Whatever we decided.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Wait. No, I wasn&#39;t talking to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, please hold on one sec. I&#39;m listening.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Patrick: </strong><br />Oh, I&#39;m just going to order the the. Do you want the big or small one or the wider one?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Wider.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Patrick: </strong><br />Okay. That&#39;s what I was going to get. But I want to make sure and I based it on the four inch wide, even if they want a three and a half that way we have.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah exactly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Patrick: </strong><br />And it says 16 yards. I&#39;m ordering the 25.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Perfect.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Patrick: </strong><br />Yeah. And it doesn&#39;t matter which gold? Just whatever we had back there?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Just whatever we used, it&#39;s just the same one.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Patrick: </strong><br />The same. I&#39;ll go make sure we get the same one. Okay? Yeah. Thanks.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Cool. Thanks, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I hear you. And it sounds like this is all going one way. And that&#39;s I get it. And I&#39;ll work along with you to make that happen.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t. I... You&#39;re going to say the same thing. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to say. And so that&#39;s fine. It just feels like, okay, cool. If it&#39;s on my end and it&#39;s 100% on my end and there&#39;s no discussions for those, then.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, that&#39;s that&#39;s unfortunate because that&#39;s all feelings. Because I sat here and listened and I&#39;m trying... for you to say no one&#39;s listening and no one wants to fix...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And you dont... and you dont agreee. And so there&#39;s no agreeing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Wait, no. Wait, wait. What? Don&#39;t agree on what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You don&#39;t... anything.....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s, like ten things we&#39;re talking about here, so....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There are and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t agree on what? That you should have more?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes. You don&#39;t agree there should be...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No. I do not agree on that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So am I not allowed to not be on board with that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re 100% allowed to. Okay, but if there&#39;s no room for further discussion of that, then all it does is put it in my court to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />(JZ roleplays with roles reversed):
Well, here, no, I want, I want I want more of yours then let&#39;s talk about that. I want more. Let&#39;s talk about it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. What do... You feel that you&#39;re entitled to... to more?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />(JZ roleplays with roles reversed):
I do now, yes. Now that I see how this is in your mind. Yeah. Okay, sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Or maybe am I doing this to show you what the real answer is that you give to someone who says something like that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay? I mean, I don&#39;t know what for you to say, what to say to you or. Okay, I heard what you said. I heard you. I mean. I mean, whatever that involves involves lawyers. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. Yes, it involves lawyers, but it also doesn&#39;t need to involve lawyers to the extent of me just deciding that that&#39;s fine if that&#39;s your decision. And then my decision is to say, that&#39;s fine, I will just then.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s your decision. We currently have an agreement.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />My decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right. So all of this. He doesn&#39;t want to hear me. All of this. You have an idea that you want to do. It takes both of us to sign on for it. It isn&#39;t &quot;he won&#39;t hear me on this.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I heard you. I just... that&#39;s not what I signed on for.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes. So it is my the decision is for me to either say that I&#39;m comfortable then just staying with things and or I&#39;m not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I know. And no one&#39;s forcing you to either direction. This call was organized by you. I hear you. Um. If you wanted to work with me on it to make it work, I&#39;m right here. Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But these are the things that would need to be worked on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well if you could get over being equal to me, then we could fix the workload. Short of that, I mean, to be honest, I don&#39;t want to work with someone who feels they&#39;re better than me in something that someone built together.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It has nothing to do with being better than somebody. It&#39;s a value to a business. If you were to let&#39;s. Lets take that away...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know we are not a business. You and I are not a business. That is what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m saying I&#39;m not a business person. I started something that turned into a business with you. I don&#39;t want to be part of a business that is not something that I align with. And I don&#39;t align with... I can&#39;t do that. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand, because they&#39;re business decisions to be made. It has nothing to do with friends.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />This isn&#39;t a business decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, so we can table that and say, okay, a change from a 50/50 partnership is not an option. You feel that the value for somebody if I was Jay or if it was you in a position or if it is me generating solely these sales, that those elements...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you&#39;re the one making it so only you could generate those sales. When trying...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No I&#39;m not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We have said, let&#39;s try to put together a sales team and I could even manage them and you said you can&#39;t do that, it would slow you down. And I mean,

I guess I could take on sales as well again, which I told you I planned on doing. But again, it comes down to wanting to be part of something where I&#39;m offended.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay so....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean... between you and me, I can&#39;t believe you would ask me that, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, because that was the same thing seven years ago, and I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be any different at all points because you clearly do not see it and it has nothing to do with anybody..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You paint that picture yourself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I do not. I absolutely do not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You put up the walls that make it so only you... You got mad when I said we need another sales person. 

You said, &quot;Do you think I can&#39;t do it all myself?&quot;

And my answer was:
&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone can. I don&#39;t think any bank would ever invest any money into a business that had one sales person.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And then you sort of like paint yourself into this cycle of:

&quot;I need this, I need this, I need this&quot;, because you&#39;re doing it in between phone calls. 

This is a solvable issue and I have answers for that, but because of the:

&quot;I&#39;m go, go, go, go.&quot; This is you. &quot;I have a million things on my plate. I have a million things on my plate. I have a million things on my plate.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It sort of sets in motion a train, that is only controlled by complete chaos on our end and forever keeps you seeing that it&#39;s a shit show.

When if we went along and did things correctly and spread out the sales between multiple people like every other business in the world, we wouldn&#39;t have this issue.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So after Jay left and we had the opportunity to have another salesperson.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you don&#39;t think having a salesperson would help you?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m... I&#39;m addressing that. We had another salesperson. And you were uncomfortable with that salesperson.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Who&#39;s that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That was my only support</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Who?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />for the time being, Suzanne.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, no, no, no. I did not have any trouble with Suzanne at all. Please don&#39;t say that. I never did. I never had any issue. I did ask you.... I honestly, I&#39;d have to look to remember there was something I asked you, like if it was somehow involved with Corona or one of those things, something like that. But I mean, did I ever tell you don&#39;t use her? I, I said don&#39;t use her?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />please pull it up.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Absolutely. Absolutely. You said it in multiple conversations to the point where. That&#39;s where I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas. Come on, just say a date, and I want to pull one up on you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I would have to go through. I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Do you think that I would be dumb enough to tell you anything about your wife besides that one time you had her call me and have her talk down to me and say all that weird stuff. Besides that, I would never say anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. But you did. And you didn&#39;t it wasnt...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I did not. I did not. I never said do not use Suzanne. And..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You said that it made you uncomfortable and you said that you don&#39;t want that to be the case. And I said that was fine because all I simply saw it as was a support system. In the meantime, while I completely lost that from Jay and that&#39;s fine. It has nothing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not this is. If this is the case and I said that I was 1,000% wrong, I can&#39;t imagine I would ever say that. I just hear me out here. I don&#39;t recall saying that. I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t imagine that I would tell you to not. I do sort of remember saying when you were like, you don&#39;t even know what she does here. And I was like, well, because you don&#39;t tell me and I can&#39;t assume what&#39;s going on over there. Maybe something like that. I do remember that. And I do remember saying, because you don&#39;t tell us when you do explode and say, do you don&#39;t she was doing this and this and this and this. I didn&#39;t know that. And it really is usually me trying to get to the bottom of how I could help you so you could paint this however you like. But there&#39;s a reality to it. And if I said that I am wrong, but I don&#39;t recall saying anything like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, that&#39;s fine. And I don&#39;t need.. that&#39;s I accept that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And dude, I have no problem with Suzanne at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s... I understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, you bring things up that are just aren&#39;t... I mean, these are the things that stick in your head. And then when we talk about them, that never happened.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, it absolutely did happen.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you&#39;re saying you have it in writing? I said I don&#39;t want Suzanne working for me... for Rowboat.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />For it was multiple conversations,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Multiple conversations..?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Im sure that there are some in texts. I&#39;m sure that there were some always in phone calls as well. But it doesn&#39;t this is I&#39;m not building a case for you to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, no. I&#39;m just letting you see... So you&#39;re saying that I say that &quot;there could only be one sales person and that&#39;s the way it is? And just figure it out? Bring the money in?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. I&#39;m just I&#39;m just using it as an example of it was one more thing to me that was, look, I have... Not only we&#39;re coming off of Covid, we had the opportunity we had the opportunity to have...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, this is this is like I&#39;m saying, I&#39;ve never said this. So I&#39;m going to pull up... I&#39;m going to just search her name, dude.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t have the time for you to... You can do this in your off time.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Hey, there&#39;s always a &quot;let me just throw this out there may be true, it may be not. Joe. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;

I do worry about it because I would never say this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Just make a note of it and do it in your off time then why are we going to.... there&#39;s other things to tend to that we can discuss.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know and you can&#39;t discuss any of them because we talk about something. It&#39;s either..I don&#39;t..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t have. Time for you to dig through your text messages right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I mean, it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Its unnecessary for this. If you feel like you need to build your anti ammunition against this Supreme Court case, go ahead and do it in your own time. I&#39;m simply just saying.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I only care about what you and I think and it upsets me that you think this stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t even care what I think about it. All I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;m using it as an example of when I had opportunity to do that, not only because there was no big, no warrior moment of &quot;Let me do it all by myself&quot;, it was the fact that we had again, zero money to be able to find people.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re talking to me like this because I agree with you. I don&#39;t... I never told you to not use her. I made the account for you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, but I mean, come on. Don&#39;t.... I mean, you&#39;re going on and on about something that I know is not true and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay And that would be a very grave misunderstanding.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Please if you... if you say you have it in text, please send it to me. and this is it a &quot;Show it to me&quot;.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know if I have it in text. I don&#39;t even care if I have it in text.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you just said it several times. You said several times it&#39;s happened.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, there were several times.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And the words were, &quot;Do not let Suzanne work for Rowboat?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I do not feel comfortable and I do not want her to be in a position. Yes. Yes. In fact, I distinctly remember actually where one of them was, where I was sitting in the car.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh. So I&#39;m typing in not comfortable. And I think I remember this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Again.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t because if you&#39;re if you&#39;re latching on to stuff that isn&#39;t true and that is the reason for all of this, it&#39;s kind of upsetting. And I do remember what you&#39;re talking about because there&#39;s there&#39;s another element to it that has nothing to do with her helping. It&#39;s her...it was you were doing all the constellation shit. You went and did that event.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, this was that was way after that. That was after she was already done. Had nothing. We we stopped because I saw what the situation was. And then she got hired for Constellation. That constellation comment that you made was probably three months ago. Okay. She&#39;s been working there for probably a year. So that&#39;s a completely separate situation. And Yes, was was I extremely offended by that? Yeah, because once again, it was why am I getting grilled for something that you assume you did not some big.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You did not... Okay, I&#39;m gonna pull these up and. And when they show something completely different, will you apologize?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, because we had the conversation about that. And after that is when you said again, Oh, if that&#39;s not the case, and you put me in a position of saying, &quot;are you not doing things... there&#39;s no additional source of revenue that is coming through any sort of partnership that has any involvement with her?&quot;

And I was so confused by that. I asked about that, too. And you brought up the fact that she was a driver in a staffing agency that was somehow circumventing revenue again to our company and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, I said &quot;I didn&#39;t see any payments come out of the account for whoever it was for the Summerfest things.&quot; And I said, &quot;Do you guys have another business where she is doing the staffing?

And the reason I said that was she when she handled all that shit with Summerfest and all that, she referred to him as her girls. They were all people who used to work with her and I didn&#39;t see any bills come through. So I asked you, &quot;Do you have another thing going on?&quot; And I asked you that because of previous... oh you?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. Keep going. They (airpods) both died, so keep going.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t need to keep going through this. I mean, everything everything that comes out of my mouth just reminds me of why I don&#39;t want to be part of this anyway. So it is what it is. If you change your mind. I&#39;m still here to work, but just let me know what you&#39;re doing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So beyond..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I can figure it out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...that part of it was the conversation that I was saying. So if I or you or anybody for that matter, is the driving factor in sales, you you feel like that is something as a 50/50 business that we are both splitting the revenue for something like that. If there are things if we have a guy, John Doe, that is out there doing $4 billion worth of sales, there&#39;s no incentive for him to continue doing that versus bringing in all of that as a 50/50 business business and we&#39;re both sharing in that? If you were if you were to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you weren&#39;t being paid to be the owner at the same time. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. That&#39;s fine. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, because your side that your working on, sales, involves money, what are what are my incentives? I get more production time? because I do better?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not even... I&#39;m just... I&#39;m.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just saying, everything that you bring in, I have to rise to the occasion to produce.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not necessarily at all. There&#39;s a lot that 100%. You do not have to even be involved in the conversations and or any of any part of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And you feel I shouldn&#39;t have any money of that either, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m just raising that as an element.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Just less? Just less?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t attribute any sort of proportion to it whatsoever.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But more than 50% would be coming out of my side. Correct? So I say less. Less is the ultimate goal. So you could have more.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You could say less or you could say more. It doesn&#39;t... It would be the same thing again if it was me sitting in a seat or if it was Jay sitting in a seat.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, there&#39;s two different things there. It&#39;s not the same because you get the profit from everything. That means you would be double dipping because then you&#39;d get profit off the shit that you just got paid on. Yeah, I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m bringing it up as an opportunity, and I&#39;m bringing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not an opportunity. Opportunity for me to make less because you don&#39;t want to have sales people?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Again for your Supreme Court case. There&#39;s no part of me or my record that has ever said anything about not wanting more salespeople. The driving factor of not having more salespeople is that there is no money to hire those salespeople.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Why?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I do the continued diligence of talking to those people meetings that you&#39;re not even involved in because there&#39;s no point to even continue to drive them further. They&#39;re eager to come work, but also what they&#39;re asking for is nothing that we&#39;re capable of paying right now, and we&#39;re also not capable of managing them. And part of that is a defining choice of mine to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t want to manage them because I don&#39;t want to attribute any more of my time than what is already attributed to this with the current reality of the business.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. Your answer is I want to do less and make more. Is that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, that literally is the crux.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If that&#39;s what you feel it is, then thats what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean. It can be boiled down to that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. Yes. Do I want more? Sure. Do I need to do less to get more? No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Do I have and have I had opportunity in the past to say I could just go somewhere else and I could take everything that I do there and not have worry about all of this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you can&#39;t. You can&#39;t?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean, I can&#39;t?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you think I could just open a business and take all of Rowboat&#39;s customers?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t need to take any of Rowboat&#39;s customers.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You just said take what. You do over there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Take what I do. Yes. As me and my asset of tools. Yes. I don&#39;t need to take any one of them. Every single one of them that I create and I cultivate the relationship. I&#39;m capable of doing a million times over with different people and different states that have no attachment to us whatsoever. You don&#39;t think that that&#39;s something that has not only that keeps me up for days to that why why would I have to not only deal with this and be stressed out with this and the relationship of this where I could probably go get a well-paying job for everything that I can bring in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I want you to. I want you to. No one is forcing you to stay here. If you&#39;re unhappy, go. It&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, this is. What are you laughing about, man? I mean, this is an issue you brought up. What you&#39;re saying is irreconcilable on my end, and it just leaves us to say, hey, I mean, I don&#39;t know what to tell you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t leave us anywhere. It leaves me still. The decision is mine. And that&#39;s where it leaves me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No. And I have to sit here and run this thing to not knowing what&#39;s going on. Right? And not knowing what I should be doing about my future. I just have to sit and wait until you tell me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, that&#39;s. I mean, that&#39;s another conversation that I&#39;ve asked you multiple times of what you can....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Can we talk about now instead of &quot;remember when we had this conversation back...?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What&#39;s your... I asked you. Okay. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What&#39;s your plan? What is a potential plan?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The same one that I told you, I want to say Thursday and Friday.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That was what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We just start doing, what we were going to do anyway with the lawyers and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Beyond beyond. The business closes tomorrow. What&#39;s your plan?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ll figure it out. I mean, this is my plan. It&#39;s sort of being stepped on right now, but I&#39;ll figure it out if you want me to have that conversation with you about what my options are so you could choose what you&#39;re going to do, that&#39;s not going to happen. I mean, I&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t worry about me. I mean, I&#39;m not following here. I mean, it&#39;s like there&#39;s issues, but when we talk about them, we can&#39;t.... they fall apart.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They&#39;re not falling apart. They&#39;re just irreconcilable. That&#39;s where they are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, yeah, the. You want more? I mean, you&#39;re shocked by that, that that I would give up.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not necessarily shocked at all. I&#39;m just I&#39;m. I&#39;m just more solidified in the position of saying, okay, it&#39;s it&#39;s again my decision to make I know on what I do to proceed. And unfortunately....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean you just decided to change the game out of nowhere. &quot;I deserve more or or give me an answer or I&#39;ll just let you know that is know&quot;. I mean that is what happened.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t decide that. And it hasn&#39;t changed since the earlier days of things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean. I&#39;m just trying to be agreeable and get us to the next thing. I hear you. I mean..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is no next thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The next thing I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The next thing would be just me on my end deciding what I want to do. And the next thing of that probably still involves attorneys because and short of that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I say let&#39;s do that. And your answer is, &quot;well, what are they going to say?&quot;

I don&#39;t know. You have to ask them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What outcome would be ideal for you? And I&#39;m not asking in an asshole way. I&#39;m being serious.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />An understanding of why I feel that way and understanding of, okay, maybe that makes sense and maybe it doesn&#39;t make sense. And I don&#39;t think in any sort of business conversation to say that it has anything to do with me feeling like this is a driving force to say that you&#39;re not an equal to me. I think that it&#39;s an understanding of why I would have these issues and why I would want to bring them to the table to discuss. And and that&#39;s all that I can ask.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We could we could discuss all of them except the 50%, because, I mean, that is the sole reason that I&#39;m part of this is because we are a team that&#39;s... And if we can&#39;t be a team, I don&#39;t want to be part of it. So it&#39;s not me being not agreeable. It&#39;s just that&#39;s not an option.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not saying. You&#39;re not being agreeable. I&#39;m saying you&#39;re entitled to that decision. That&#39;s your decision. And as a result of that decision becomes my choice of a decision. And the other element of that, whether that&#39;s in a sales role for you or for me, regardless, is that&#39;s simply a bullet point on my list of saying it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t seem fair. It doesn&#39;t seem right. I can hear your side. I can hear your reasoning. And ultimately, again, if you&#39;re not agreeable to it, then your not agreeable with it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Would we not agree? Would you sign on for trading every other month? You come here and run production and I get to do sales.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So we switch. So we switch off.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see that as where the role... I mean, that&#39;s that&#39;s a completely different thing of saying, okay, well now all of a sudden you want to jump into being a doctor versus not being a doctor. That&#39;s not what the roles have become and what the....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I only say this stuff to jolt you into thinking outside of for yourself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just I think it&#39;s a ridiculous statement to make.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. And that&#39;s exactly. I feel the exact same way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s what you do, though. It&#39;s not just to say come in a role and say that&#39;s what you do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I could do. I do sales, too, and I crushed it. I did all sorts of sales. But what I&#39;m getting at is. I&#39;m merely pointing out that if you were to look at it from my side. I think you&#39;d be upset.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I would say the same thing. So it&#39;s the same stalemate of 15 years now?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m not the one judging each other&#39;s value. I&#39;m saying we are equal value no matter how much work either of us are doing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, that&#39;s your decision and that&#39;s your I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not my decision. This is the decision we made when we started it. That continues to be my decision. You&#39;re asking to change it. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t think we should change it. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. And that&#39;s your decision. I don&#39;t... I mean you agree to that. I don&#39;t agree to that. So that&#39;s where it is. And it&#39;s.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know we&#39;re in the same spot we were two hours ago when I said &quot;okay.&quot; I mean, I hear you, dude.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. So sorry. I mean, I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s there is nothing else to say, and I don&#39;t think that you&#39;ve heard...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There is... We have payroll coming up. I don&#39;t know how much money&#39;s in the bank account. I haven&#39;t looked at it yet. We got all sorts of things coming up. There&#39;s bills, there&#39;s all sorts of stuff. So anything that you&#39;re... comes across your plate that you think I should take a look at because you&#39;re not going to just let me know and I&#39;ll.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s there&#39;s been no point in this where I said I will not I will not be doing anything whatsoever, and nor have I ever said that. And so I&#39;m aware of all of those things. They became a big part of the conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I say this because when I say, what are you going to say to S&amp;S You say, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What what will I say to them? I will find a way to lie to them that we don&#39;t have money. That&#39;s all that I can say.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, no we could come up with something, talking to each other, saying that it was fraud, which it it&#39;s starting to turn out to be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It has nothing to do with the bank account. We can fully pay from the bank account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it. But for. Okay. I was saying for sewing a story that buys us more time. You could say our account got held for fraud.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They know that. I&#39;ve said I&#39;ve had the same conversation for two weeks with them. They don&#39;t care what it is. They just need their money. That&#39;s what it is. So there&#39;s not really even I mean, the conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I just put money in. You said you were going to put money in to. Are you going to do that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I&#39;m asking you the question I&#39;m asking you because things have changed, apparently. So Is that still something you&#39;re going to do?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I would I would prefer to have your money returned, but which is why I would like to see what the amount of money that has to be paid out so we can make a decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I would just say I don&#39;t need it, need it back.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But please, let me let me follow through if we want to just put it to the side when we get it back and keep it there, that is fine, is what I was going to say so we could keep it there as a cushion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand. I would prefer to not do that, which is what I&#39;m trying just to get at with how much is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get that. But knowing how to transfer money in and out takes fucking days and I can&#39;t transfer out of there. I mean, I guess I technically can, but just don&#39;t... Just in keeping money there, put it in a savings. I mean, it being there doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, but I don&#39;t that&#39;s. Yes, that&#39;s an amount of money. Is that an amount of money that is necessary for us? No, we still need more. That has to come in, which is part of my continued path for today of figuring out everybody that&#39;s still owes us money, that is not bringing in money along with whatever I can continue to do to generate future sales. But there&#39;s just same thing that I said with Happy Monkey is like at a certain point I cannot physically make them just have money appear and I cannot physically.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not like blaming you for the amount of money coming in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Im not saying that you are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I want you to know I&#39;m not holding.... I understand these people pay when they pay. Now...okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I hear you. And I. Hear you. I love you. And we will figure it out, bro. Okay. I mean, that&#39;s that&#39;s all I could say right now. I mean, I&#39;ve seen the future and it works out and we&#39;re both happy. I mean, short of saying that, I don&#39;t know what I could say. I talk to my lawyer on Friday, I could set something up if you&#39;d like to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What.. Whatever you... It goes both ways. If you feel that that&#39;s best on your end, well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you&#39;re pushing towards wanting more and it not being a partnership like that, a 50/50 anymore, then you want to change the way things are. And I don&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And, and that is a unproductive conversation for not only both you and I to have,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How? Why?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...but also to other people, because it&#39;s not something that&#39;s negotiable.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. Exactly. You&#39;re... </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So it&#39;s a partnership, a 50/50.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And you&#39;re trying to change it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I understand that. I&#39;m I&#39;m. I have no choice but to accept your decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You have a choice to honor what is already in place that we&#39;ve already agreed upon.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Correct. Correct.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So if you would like to change the game, there is the chance that the other person won&#39;t be into it. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to hear you. It&#39;s just that is not what we either of us signed up for. So, I mean, if if I say I&#39;m leaving, if you don&#39;t give me another ten grand a month, which doesn&#39;t exist, it&#39;s not &quot;Well, you&#39;re unreasonable!&quot; It&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re unreasonable. I&#39;m saying I respect your decision. And I&#39;m. All I&#39;m saying is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You just said &quot;it&#39;s non-negotiable. You&#39;re saying it&#39;s non-negotiable.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, it is. You&#39;re not. You&#39;re not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s no. There&#39;s nothing to negotiate on. There&#39;s something in place you want to change. And you&#39;re asking if you&#39;d like me to change.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Exactly. It&#39;s. That is a non-negotiable. Yes. It doesn&#39;t. There&#39;s no conversation, whether it&#39;s between you and I, whether it&#39;s between 14 lawyers and 14 lawyers, that will change that decision. And that&#39;s it is what it is. I&#39;m just saying...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Instead of wanting for us both to do better, you want a piece of mine? My my answer for us to both do better is we just make the business better and it funnels to us like on every savings. But if your answer is, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll just take it out of Joe&#39;s cut. That&#39;s counter to anything that I&#39;d like to be part of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s, it&#39;s, not. But that&#39;s also doesn&#39;t necessarily mean.... It doesn&#39;t.... It&#39;s.... I...get it. I respect your decision, and I have no choice to respect your decision. All I simply was saying in reaction to saying...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, you have no choice but to continue to honor the decision we both made when we started.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Creative wording pushes things in a different narrative.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean.. It doesn&#39;t... that&#39;s doesn&#39;t.... none of it really changes anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand the situation. It just is... That&#39;s the.... it&#39;s... it is what it is. So again, in my response to you saying, would you like you to talk to your lawyer to set up an appointment? My response was simply, that&#39;s fine if you would like to do that. I don&#39;t feel that that&#39;s a productive conversation because...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If we don&#39;t do that, then you say, &quot;Well, then we just leave this with I guess it&#39;s all up to me?&quot; So my only way I could make that not all by you is to say, okay, let me put this into motion with the lawyer. You. I mean, you realize that it&#39;s like there&#39;s no... I&#39;m wrong no matter what in this situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. But what... But what are you... What is your...?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just trying to be agreeable. And so it&#39;s not us just leaving with &quot;it&#39;s on you to figure it out, Lucas.&quot; It&#39;s.. I put into motion something. So I&#39;m not just being bogus.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The only part that is on me to figure out is, is what my decision for my life would be. Which that&#39;s same is, is you. That doesn&#39;t involve me having to go to an attorney and say, &quot;Hey, I would just like to move on from this business and I&#39;d like to take a job at X, Y, Z place.&quot;

I mean, that&#39;s... that doesn&#39;t... I don&#39;t... think that&#39;s anybody&#39;s position to make. If my choice is to to resign, then that&#39;s my choice to do just as much as it is yours. I&#39;m just simply saying that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know I didn&#39;t bring this up. I didn&#39;t say I want to have a meeting to let you know sometime in the future what I might possibly do. I&#39;m just trying to hear you out, be supportive, be understanding, try to make things better in the interim.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s all you can do and that&#39;s fine. And I appreciate that and accept that. And it&#39;s still it&#39;s not me turning and saying, great, it&#39;s all on me to decide, but it&#39;s all on me to decide because it&#39;s my it&#39;s...it&#39;s my own decision to make within myself. If I feel that&#39;s the best for me to do, then fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If that&#39;s the best decision for me to do and enact in four years, then then we have that conversation then. So it&#39;s not me giving you the ultimatum of saying, Oh, here&#39;s the ticking time bomb. My intention... </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Its worse. You say you don&#39;t care and at some point it might bubble into something really bad that involves both of us paying money. So, I mean, for you to throw up a flare like this and then be upset when there is nothing moving forward, which you don&#39;t want to move forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t say I don&#39;t want to move forward with anything I say it&#39;s my choice to make that decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. And that&#39;s where we&#39;re at, and I respect that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s it. I mean, that&#39;s where it lies. It&#39;s the same. Whereas fucking depressing as that is on both sides to say, okay,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So now it&#39;s business as usual until until it&#39;s not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s all that we can say. I don&#39;t. I mean, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what else to say to that. Or there is no marching productive x, y, z list of &quot;Okay, let&#39;s start doing this&quot;, because you&#39;ve heard me and I&#39;ve heard you and that&#39;s where we are. So I don&#39;t know unless you feel like there&#39;s anything more to share about that. Then I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what else to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t have anything else to add.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All right. So I would say the only things in moving forward that are possible are if you&#39;re able to help me with what those values are so we can back into what&#39;s going on money wise, then it&#39;s just going to be another conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Values for for for what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />In the doc of what has to be paid. What&#39;s either to be paid.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... That sheet?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And. I don&#39;t know what more what more to do beyond the both of us continue to do and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All right. I&#39;m going to go start weeding (vinyl).</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re confident about that or?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No? I took it on to take some stuff off your plate and handle that and painted myself into a horrible corner. But I&#39;ll make it work.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I appreciate that. But I also that&#39;s part of the conversation that we had last week. That doesn&#39;t... it helps, but it also... I don&#39;t know... I don&#39;t know...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It helps. It keeps Brand Addition here, which is something you&#39;re trying to land and keep happy. So I did everything I could to land and keep happy, but then we just move on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. Well, I appreciate you hearing things. And yeah, there&#39;s a lot of stuff on both sides and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I have nothing on my side. I&#39;m not asking for anything from you except just your assistance in what we&#39;ve been currently doing, we&#39;ve been doing for the last 16 years. I&#39;m not... there&#39;s a lot of things that.. I.. would make my life better, but... I try to make things better on my own.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, maybe that&#39;s conversation then of maybe..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Everything&#39;s a conversation, like we can never talk about the actual conversation. But I mean....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just going to say what the conversation is. Maybe then maybe it&#39;s better that I&#39;m gone. Maybe that&#39;s a conversation. I don&#39;t know how we say it&#39;s a conversation without it not being in conversation. Maybe it&#39;s better without me. I don&#39;t know. I mean, that&#39;s all I can can can say to that. That is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, this is brought up by you and controlled by you, so don&#39;t put it in my court.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m just saying that that&#39;s.... That can be an option. I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s an option or a right option.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What would be.. what. would the option be?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If I leave, I&#39;ll say that&#39;s fine. You want to whatever...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And then that&#39;s just it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Like we wouldn&#39;t have to break anything up or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, we would just say whatever...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Like I&#39;m not coming in on Monday or ever? Is... What would the answer? I mean, is what you&#39;re saying?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. I&#39;m not saying that. No. I&#39;m saying if that&#39;s the if you chose the same as if you said, look, cool, I&#39;m not happy with this. But if you feel that it&#39;s better without me, then cool. How do we get to that point? If you&#39;re if you&#39;re not in a position to feel that it&#39;s amicable to work in a situation that is... </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Where one person said that they&#39;re more valuable than the other?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t want to work like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. So in that same sentence, if you feel that both parties are equally as valuable to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I do. I mean, I think you forget what goes on over here, but...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t forget.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But. I mean, that&#39;s the age old for for anybody that is feeling like, okay, well....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, it&#39;s only you&#39;re the only one who sees it that way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, no, there&#39;s a good majority of the world that sees it that way. And then says okay, everybody who&#39;s the sales person is the asshole salesperson that thinks they&#39;re the top of the world and they see it as, okay, well, I&#39;m the person that is bringing in things and you&#39;re making things. And I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m on either side of those conversations, but I&#39;m saying that I&#39;m aware that that&#39;s all that that&#39;s just part of the world.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Not in my world.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So I guess let&#39;s just...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Throw it all away over a percentage and and something that we built, the two of us, every part of it. You&#39;d throw away the whole machine because you can&#39;t have more.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s not actually... I mean, that&#39;s a asset and a factor more so it&#39;s the it&#39;s the toxic relationship between both of us that is the. And that&#39;s not. You can&#39;t put a.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I try to ignore all the outrageous stuff you say to me. I never say any stuff like that to you because I know it&#39;s permanent and for you to say that there&#39;s a toxic relationship between us when you know that I&#39;m always standing right here ready to talk. No matter what has happened between us is upsetting. And you know, you know I&#39;d do anything for us without ever thinking and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, there&#39;s nothing to be. I mean, it&#39;s the in any sort of relationship, it doesn&#39;t....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />This isn&#39;t a relationship. I mean, me walking on eggshells, you demanding &quot;Where has this been? It&#39;s been 40 minutes. Are you fucking kidding me? What the fuck?&quot; Everything, dude. I mean. And all I could do is just not answer. Otherwise, it&#39;s a new problem, and I&#39;m willing to work with that. I get it. I know you don&#39;t mean it, but. Dude, I&#39;ll go to a fucking couple&#39;s counseling. I&#39;ll do all that stuff. Any of it. And I&#39;ve always been open to anything, man. So if you&#39;re just trying to find reasons to get out of this because this has become like a the same hell that I&#39;m in, I get it. I just. I don&#39;t blame you. And I want to make things better. I try to think of it as how do we make things better for both of us?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But sometimes that&#39;s not possible. And that you have to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Why? Why is it not possible?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, the same reason that I&#39;m not dating a girl from college, that it sometimes it just doesn&#39;t work anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But if I&#39;m not your girlfriend, we&#39;re talking business transactions. I&#39;m either doing my job or not, and we&#39;re either coming up with shit or we&#39;re not. So I get it. I mean, trust me. I&#39;m tired of it, too. It&#39;s it&#39;s not productive when two people are in the same hell and one person is just standing looking at the other one like &quot;the other person could have done so much better.&quot; That is not how you get anywhere.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Maybe not. But also part of it is just standing there, being able to look at it for year after year and saying it&#39;s just not going to get better.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I mean, all the hurdles to make it better are being held by you. Well, I mean, I&#39;m telling you for real. Think of it. More sales people, more money coming in. Can I? You&#39;d be cool if I just said, hey, this is the new sales person. I can make that happen somehow and then I handle it over here and you just go off and do your own thing and. I mean, that is the answer. More money coming in is the answer. How do we do that? You hire someone, you don&#39;t want to do that because you&#39;re worried about the numbers. It&#39;s it&#39;s a cycle that we create for ourselves, which is all held into place by knowing no one being able to talk to you about how we fix it because you&#39;re always too busy. There&#39;s always too many things, there&#39;s always this, there&#39;s always that. And it&#39;s always just, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re just.... you need to bury yourself? But if you think anything other places are going to be better, you&#39;re mistaken. It doesn&#39;t get any better than being with someone who&#39;s been with you forever and who could forget everything, bro? I mean, even if we just build it to keep a fucking kickstand up on it and let someone else handle it, that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s what I was planning on doing, like we talked about. But I mean, this introspective that you&#39;re having on, you know, introspective on Lucas. Life is scary, bro.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know what to tell you, but I can tell you what would be intelligent would be for us to just get along and keep this going while we figure out our next steps instead of figuring out our next steps in a hell that we can control. I want you to be happy, bro. I&#39;m not going to force you into anything, but there&#39;s a light at the end of the tunnel. There&#39;s a way to get to it and I&#39;ll dig to it with a spoon if I have to, bro. For both of us.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I&#39;m not trying to make you feel bad or anything, I&#39;m just saying let that soak in. However, whatever we are working towards, I want it to be beneficial for both of us. And I want us to both both be happy. And there&#39;s an intelligent way to do that, which involves the least amount of stress. And we&#39;ll get there, bro. Even if we&#39;re just talking interim shit. I don&#39;t want you to be like that. I don&#39;t want you being upset. We&#39;ll get there, bro. And this isn&#39;t just a &quot;Oh, whatever.&quot; There is no &quot;Oh, whatever.&quot; Don&#39;t forget, no matter what happens on the first of the month, I owe 4000 fucking dollars every month before myself. And I&#39;m very protective of that. And if you think I would ever do anything to harm the business, it&#39;s wishful thinking.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that. And I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And it&#39;s upsetting when there&#39;s facts and no one wants to look at them. But it... it doesn&#39;t matter. I mean, everything was a bogus and a lie. And it&#39;s always something with that phone thing. But here I am going to court because it&#39;s all true. I live in a crazy ass world. I live in fucking Chicago. I know it&#39;s not fucking like by you. Everyone&#39;s a fucking asshole and has power to fucking get back to the person who signed their name on everything. So every time I rent a hotel and I mean, only time you ever hear anything bad is when I got fucked over. I didn&#39;t show up out of nowhere being a fucking dick. It&#39;s. I got fucked, and I was rude. Not. Not directly. It&#39;s. I mean, I&#39;m just saying, this is. This is what keeps you up at night. I guarantee you, if someone bought the fucking place, what happens when that fucking person goes and says some crazy shit on the internet? What happens when you get recorded saying some stupid shit at a fucking school? I mean...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well that&#39;s partly what I was</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Exactly but but I know that you have a family and bills and you&#39;re not stupid enough to do stuff like that. I know. And is it possible that in any of these situations you heard that I thought out every single fucking move and that was the most intelligent fucking way to handle it? Yeah, it&#39;s totally possible. But no explaining it to the guy. To my dad. I just have to fucking sit and explain to you non-stop as you just go. Yeah, sure. It&#39;s always somebody else. Well. I don&#39;t know what to tell you. I went into a bank. I stood up. I have the. I&#39;m going to send you this recording. You can listen to it if you want. You can listen to the whole fucking thing of the guy trying to figure out what the fuck the problem was. But if it makes you feel better to think that it was my fault, I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t help when the fraud happened. The reason they might have not overlooked it might have been because of whatever fucking they had there of me standing up, no yelling, no screaming, no swearing, nothing, nothing to the point where they would even write there laughing at me, which is crazy. And I don&#39;t want to just keep going over it. But you could paint a story in your mind however you want, but if you don&#39;t want to look at the facts, then you just want the situation. Now, I don&#39;t want to sit and explain my fucking self to anybody. Ever. Ever. There&#39;s only one person I do it left for my beautiful bride, Lucas Guariglia. I said that to make you smile. Come on, man. And I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not going to talk you out of whatever&#39;s in your mind, but I&#39;m hoping you could see. It&#39;s not what it really can be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think that it is, and I don&#39;t think that it is that it has to be. And I don&#39;t think any part of me is sitting here continually... Yes, there are the days in the moments that I&#39;m on the other side of why do I have to deal with this? But I&#39;m looking at it as it&#39;s not going to change.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. And that&#39;s... That&#39;s on you, man. Like..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br /> It&#39;s not. It&#39;s been 16 years.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And look and look. Right? So you say all those nights you stayed up, all those nights that you&#39;re talking about, has there any of that brought you... Is there anything right now that you could say was brought to you by doing that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean? Brought to me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Like, has there. Has there been any benefit of years of sitting and saying, Joe&#39;s going to fuck up everything and I&#39;m being... I know you&#39;re not saying that I&#39;m being ridiculous. All the worrying about everything. A: we&#39;re still here. B: If you if you get that time back, it would be fucking weeks and it brought you nothing. And during that time, you&#39;re usually upset. I&#39;m exerting energy to try to calm you down and make you see the way and appreciate stuff. And it if I don&#39;t do that, it&#39;s this all the time. And.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah but...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just want to. I just want to help, man. And I just want this to be us, like it&#39;s always been.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I understand. And I&#39;m not saying that it doesn&#39;t... It...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I don&#39;t need you to say anything, but I get it. I just. I&#39;m just trying to let you know that in all the leaps and bounds that we&#39;ve made, it always sucks to be standing behind you with you like &quot;pfff!&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s not what my reaction is. My reaction is, is you could take out every single one of whatever all the every single thing that we just went through that is affecting me. Take it all away. It doesn&#39;t change the fact within myself that just feels like I just need to move on from this and..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then do. I mean, you&#39;re like torturing me with it. Then do please.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that. I&#39;m. I&#39;m not. There&#39;s no I don&#39;t want to bring anybody into any more torture. There&#39;s no drama to me to be saying, Oh, this is fun to talk about how miserable I am.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, we&#39;re in the same like literally we have the same understanding right now that we did two hours ago.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes and and that&#39;s fine. So what what did all of that sleepless nights give to me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ll tell you what this right now shows us. We can talk, dude. We can.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />We can talk. But there is no change in the way that I feel. And I&#39;m not expecting you to. That&#39;s not an insult to you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s. It&#39;s not even anything, really. Yes. It&#39;s related to you because you&#39;re involved just as much as I&#39;m involved. I understand. I don&#39;t prefer to have these conversations. I don&#39;t want to have these conversations anymore. This, to me, was the conversation. There&#39;s no is there the... the what... however you worded it, the reaction or the expectation that I, I don&#39;t even know what my expectation was going into it and saying

&quot;okay, great, I&#39;m going to bring this up. And he&#39;s going to say, no problem. Here you go. No longer 50/50? Here&#39;s what we can do. Don&#39;t even bother about that. Oh, cool. Sales. You killed it in sales. Okay, great. Here&#39;s sales bonus for you. Here&#39;s sales bonus for me if I go into sales.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But the bonus is the owner&#39;s percentage.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t... I understand. I&#39;m just again, if that was my whole pitch to this to say we&#39;re going to talk about sales bonus, then you know me, I would have probably a better tangible example of, &quot;Hey, here&#39;s what would probably make sense. Not only just...&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We talked to Azara (John Azara from IMEC) about this, remember? And he said, You can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s illegal. But...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. Maybe so. I mean, I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">We did. He said that you would have to make yourself an employee.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Fine. I mean... I mean, I don&#39;t... I&#39;m not saying... I mean... it doesn&#39;t matter. If there were ways if there&#39;s not ways. If there&#39;s..... it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m just saying, to answer your question of all of this resulting in these constant conversations about this that don&#39;t ever get to anywhere anyway, and what are those sleepless nights add up to for me? those sleepless nights over the last two weeks have added up to this, to me, to the point to say I need to confront these things. I need to bring them up and I need to have the conversation with you, which we did. The result of that is that the conversation was held and the conversation was not held in the way that I said I was trying to not do. Because, yes, at the end of the day, we are friends. We are people that have known each other for a long time. We&#39;ve done amazing things together. Did I think that it was in the best form for me to turn that over to an attorney and say, Great, now Joe gets a letter basically saying that Lucas wants a deviation from 50/50 and wants sales bonuses and wants X, Y, Z and all of this stuff or else. No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that you do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t change the fact, but it&#39;s a different approach. And the approach being that, fine, if you and I were boyfriend and girlfriend and saying, Hey, I don&#39;t like the fact that you come home at 1 a.m. and we have to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But if we had an agreement that I come home at 1 a.m. and all of a sudden you&#39;re mad at it, that is the situation we&#39;re at.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, I understand and agree with that, but also, I don&#39;t feel that ever in business is a time that is okay... we... you guys.... First of all, we never really even agreed on it. It was just I don&#39;t even know how we it. However it just...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The bank account. The bank account. When we got the bank accounts.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. So whatever. That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you would have wanted more when we set it up. When I built the place in my basement, built all the machines, figured out the entire situation. Not that I am bringing this up to hold things over you, it&#39;s just to remind you, because it seems like as time goes on and things become normalized, we forget. We lose track of the inconvenient.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So what point did it equal out and then you were more valuable?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know what definitive date, but I think that there was certainly a...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So there&#39;s a date where everything...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. There&#39;s not a date. Is there a period of time? Maybe I don&#39;t have a date that I look back to and say, if everything would have been different on that day, my life would be different. I&#39;m also not telling you that my life would be different, even if this conversation was completely different and you said, &quot;Cool, we can do whatever you want it to be.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I could be in the same position next week and say, That&#39;s fine because it&#39;s not solely about ownership and money. It&#39;s everything else that goes along with running this business. It&#39;s everything that goes along with this industry. And there&#39;s not an answer that I&#39;m seeking from you for that at all. I&#39;m just saying these are the things that I&#39;m entitled to as a person to bring up and talk through.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And and I hear you and I want to make that happen for you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But there&#39;s and that&#39;s fine. But again, it&#39;s. There&#39;s just I mean, there&#39;s not there&#39;s nowhere to go from that. So it&#39;s cool. It is where it is. And I&#39;m sorry that you feel that it&#39;s a skewed opinion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s it&#39;s not useful to to go back and say, okay, so at what point in what day would we have been able to? Or if I felt that way when we were still in your basement? I don&#39;t know. I mean, the everything I.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; is the answer I was looking for.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, you had a completely separate business that you were doing as well, that there was never even we didn&#39;t even know better to have a conversation about that and saying, well, that doesn&#39;t even make sense. But you can&#39;t take 16 years of experience of something and saying, &quot;okay, well, this should have maybe been the case there, or I would have preferred to have this conversation then&quot; because maybe I would have made different decisions or you would have made different decisions. And that&#39;s all completely unnecessary to look back. And what&#39;s the point of that? It doesn&#39;t nothing&#39;s going to change that. So as you...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was just trying to make you feel bad by making you think back, but apparently that didn&#39;t work.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, when I think back, I do feel bad. I feel bad because of the things that I look at that I feel were skewed just as much as you probably see them that way, too. So that&#39;s the way...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Don&#39;t speak for me. I&#39;ve from day one said what we both do is always equal. I&#39;ve always said that. I&#39;ve always said that neither of us is more important than the other. I&#39;ve always said it was you and I. And I still do not think that either of us is worth more. But you&#39;re entitled to your opinion, and I appreciate it. So. Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. So there&#39;s nothing. We just....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No. I take you seriously. Mean when you&#39;re ready to do the lawyer thing, tell me and I&#39;m in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, that&#39;s fine. I appreciate that. And that&#39;s not... that&#39;s just... it is where it is. So the same as it was, we continue moving forward. I don&#39;t know what is... I don&#39;t know what is next week. I&#39;m not talking about between you and I. I don&#39;t know whats next in terms of what needs to happen beyond just understanding the values of what money has to come out. And then we can figure out what that looks like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Conversation with us and see where she is. My goal would be to say the same thing regardless of what fucking answer she gets. I&#39;m just saying, here&#39;s your 5000. Here&#39;s your 10,000. You don&#39;t need 45,000 now. And that is still their hard line of saying we&#39;re holding your account till then.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then than it is what it is. And that just becomes the account we pay first and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. I mean, there is such a thing in their world that is a specific list, that is industry known that if they&#39;re holding that, then they&#39;re going to circulate all of that. And so it&#39;s not like all of a sudden we just say, Cool, let&#39;s just start dumping tons at one stop because it is worthless. But but we do have money coming back in a rebate that is supposed to be.... And they know that too. So it doesn&#39;t... it&#39;s not $100,000 worth, but...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But how much is it relatively?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I have zero idea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />45?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I really I&#39;m going to assume between 6 and 8000 maybe. But, um, and I also don&#39;t know if that makes it available this week or how they play that game because they&#39;re in the same position. That&#39;s why they&#39;re, they&#39;re just harping on everybody. I mean, Jose this morning said, I have a customer that does $6 million a year with us. They pay $150,000 every week almost, and they never get their stuff hung up. And I&#39;m pissed that they&#39;re holding this over $390.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I get it. I mean, this is what happens when one place buys another and that board decides to do this and one place buys another. And before you, before you know it, you&#39;re holding everyone&#39;s fucking credit and you&#39;re looking at those fucking numbers you have outstanding and &quot;get that shit. I don&#39;t give a fuck.&quot; That&#39;s the answer from the board. &quot;We&#39;re not a bank.&quot; I mean, it&#39;s just one of the downsides of them buying everything. So, I mean, in the end, maybe we you say we don&#39;t have terms at Broder?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, because every time that the conversation came up, there are, of course, going to want to run their credit checks and they&#39;re going to see that you have $100,000 in and they&#39;re not going to do it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So. So, I mean, that leaves credit card.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s credit card. One stop and credit card is one thing iff we want to just get in a pattern of saying we&#39;re not paying the statement balance, then we&#39;re not eating the interest on that. But the trickle effect of that is that we now no longer are paying full on that card.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So the so you&#39;re saying like, like, let&#39;s say like, yeah, the statement balance, if we let it go one month, like that&#39;s when you start paying, right? So if you don&#39;t pay it all off by the end of the month, does it now can continue to take interest or does it just take interest until you take it to zero again?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Until it&#39;s fully paid. So right now we got 25 that if we paid the 25, we get zero interest. If we don&#39;t pay the 25 and we pay, you know, whatever the monthly minimum, let&#39;s say $400, we&#39;re going to get charged almost 18% on the full balance, which is whatever. Now the 45,000. But isn&#39;t that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Over the year?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s over the year, but it&#39;s still going to be it&#39;s like it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Still divided by 12, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. So let&#39;s say that that&#39;s 700, fine. Not the biggest issue. But what happens is now the account is not paying full so we can no longer go back to just paying. Right. Was that statement balance? So when that comes back to 60,000 next month, right. We don&#39;t have the luxury of just saying we paid 20. We just have to pay it all to zero or it&#39;s just always now. So that&#39;s what always my tactic is for that because it just it gets so big that that&#39;s going to turn up to be $700 a month even beyond what we have that money. And, you know, we&#39;re just not in a position or usually are we ever just to say, that&#39;s fine, we&#39;ll just if it gets up to 60 grand and we got 60 grand to pay it down to zero.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So, I almost would much rather have to eat the credit card fee from S&amp;S. You put it on a card to still make the statement, balance payment, and then hope that in 30 days we&#39;re not in the situation. And yes, we just saved $1,300 in charges, but whatever. It&#39;s better that than being underwater for 60 grand next month.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Agreed. I&#39;m here for anything you want to talk over or anything. Yeah. Just let me know what we need to do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I think if you just can help with the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ll fill that thing out in a sec. I got the pictures of the checks and stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s nothing else that you have on your radar of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, sales tax is today. Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But beyond that, beyond what&#39;s initially in that dock of saying these are the things that are on my mind of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I mean, I can&#39;t think of a there&#39;s nothing that I really pay for, you know what I&#39;m saying? We paid the compressor people.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Um, just payroll and those checks. Okay. Let me look at this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Here it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m looking at it.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All right.
