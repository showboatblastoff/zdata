But what are we going to do about our bills? Nothing?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because if the answer is nothing, then I got to do something on my end here.. not.. to to save, to make.. to get money coming in here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, isn&#39;t that our job to keep the business running?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, And that has been the job. And that&#39;s been the stress of the job for the last two weeks as I&#39;ve continued to do that. This is where the conversation goes, and this is where...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know... It&#39;s me listening and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s you being. It&#39;s it&#39;s you being you and it&#39;s it&#39;s every part of why don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t care about this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t need to turn over this will never go to a Supreme Court. It has nothing to do with saying okay great show your evidence.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not fighting you on anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re interrupting me is what you continue to do too..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I apologize.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...and every step of the way. If a partner on the other side of it says, I see you as a liability to the business, I have no insulation to that. I don&#39;t want any any interaction with that affecting not only the business that I&#39;m currently in and or any future businesses.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is no action for that right now. That is a legal thing that has to be taken care of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p><strong>LG states wants more ownership of RBC 5 days after account closed and new ones opened without JZ name on them</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Beyond the workload, which is nothing beyond dividing up things and trying to I&#39;m not concerned about that. Workload is workload. The value I think of our positions has been skewed and that is a conversation that I&#39;ve had multiple times with you. And whether wanna say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Skewed?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...you want to say bring up the past, whether you want</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, we&#39;re 50/50.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are saying you should be paid more than me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not only does it result to the the payment amount, I think that the equity alone, based on the value of the business, should be different.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I think that the structure of the business should be different no matter what, because that is also when more decisions unrelated to having a 50/50 conversation that never, never goes anywhere because we can never agree on anything that that&#39;s a conversation that I specifically did try to have seven years ago.</p><p><strong>actually otherway around, LG was the one who said FU you can have it all. Link here:
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And your response was, Fuck you, you can have it all. And that&#39;s where that conversation stopped. And so, yes, there&#39;s continued resentment that has built from that from a long time ago. That is still the situation. And I put it under the rug for a long time thinking things will get better. But it hasn&#39;t gotten better. And I think that that&#39;s a very valid conversation to have with any sort of partnership, regardless of one person, two people or five people. Okay. And I and again, I think that that&#39;s not a conversation that we&#39;re capable of because I&#39;ve tried to have it multiple conversations and it hasn&#39;t worked.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry. Hang on. There&#39;s... a train went by. Sorry. I couldn&#39;t hear you. All right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So I&#39;m assuming that your position is still the same position and you don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which is? Which is what? My answer was. I said, I&#39;m saying yes to anything. Everything is yes. So, I mean, I have zero position. My position is to make every day better. That&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m trying to do. And if.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes is not a is not an answer to that, nor was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not fighting you on anything. So if you say, let&#39;s talk to lawyers, let&#39;s get the lawyers, then they&#39;ll tell us what the next steps are. I don&#39;t even know what else to do besides that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If that was the one issue that we turned over to them, they are going to say, okay, so what... That conversation</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know and that&#39;s where I&#39;m... I mean, because this is on your end. I mean, how do we make whatever you want happen happen?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s a conversation that either happens or it doesn&#39;t happen because I tried to have it seven years ago and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I said, let&#39;s have it now. And there&#39;s there&#39;s no conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You feel like that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Please don&#39;t tell me what I feel. Please don&#39;t tell me what I feel or what you think.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m asking you. That was the beginning of a question before you interrupted me. You feel like that&#39;s unfounded?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Feel like what is unfounded?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You feel like me saying that the current structure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m saying I&#39;m listening to you. But if you feel that what we do is not 50/50, I... that... I disagree.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I feel like we we both put in what we both put in. And I mean, I feel like we I&#39;m not saying either one of us is doing more. I&#39;m saying both of us are providing very important functions here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I&#39;m not sitting here and valuing anything saying this part is mine, this part is his. I&#39;m not even sure what we&#39;re even talking..... A percentage of zero is zero. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, like we&#39;re talking about the structure of a business that we can&#39;t even tell you for what we&#39;re going to do about paying the bills. I mean that&#39;s pointless.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, if you if you&#39;re saying to me that you would like to acquire more of Rowboat, then that is upsetting because I&#39;ve never had a &quot;you and me&quot; in my mind, like a &quot;you or me&quot;. It was &quot;us&quot;. And I get it. I hear you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. But hearing me doesn&#39;t push that conversation forward.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It does. I mean, it does. We said we&#39;re... I have a lawyer. I mean, do you have one? Do you want me to set up an appointment? I will.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So short of that next step, that&#39;s... that&#39;s a conversation that we&#39;re incapable of, of having?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re the only one saying that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m... we&#39;re having it right now. Whether this isn&#39;t leaving here with a solve for something. I wasn&#39;t anticipating that. But I&#39;m saying that yes that&#39;s that is on however you want to put it on the list that that is it is a concern and it has been a concern.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, you just told me your thoughts. I heard them. I hear you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, if you want more of the business, I wouldn&#39;t grant you that. And I do think it would be time to... unfortunately, I mean, that only leaves one answer. When one person is unhappy and wants out and the job... the business takes both of us, then it&#39;s got to go. And it is what it is. I&#39;m not going to fight you on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What has to go?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The business.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s... that&#39;s... that&#39;s your solve?</p><p><strong>LG confirms the business will not continue unless given more ownership, after taking control of bank accounts</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, no, I mean, that&#39;s not a solve. If if I&#39;m hearing you correct, then if it doesn&#39;t happen, then what? We... The business doesn&#39;t go on, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, if you&#39;re asking for more of rowboat than 50%. I mean, we would have to just dissolve it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, so your answer is no?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, no to what? I mean... I mean... what... dude, I&#39;m so confused. Here... I&#39;m not... I really am. I&#39;m not arguing with you. I really am trying to hear you and really am trying to answer the question. Am I answering the wrong question?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, but you&#39;re answering the question. And what you&#39;re saying. The conversation is that if I&#39;m unhappy with the equity structure of the company and you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s 50/50 or it&#39;s zero, that answer to me is.</p><p><strong>JZ confirms LG is saying that business does not go on if JZ does not give up more ownership</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no. My question to you was, if you want more than 50%, is that the case?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. Well, that&#39;s not a structure I&#39;m comfortable with. So does it just continue being 50/50 or does it just go away? I mean, it&#39;s up to you then, because you&#39;re the one with the issue. I&#39;m not asking for more. That is you. So if I&#39;m... if I say I don&#39;t like that, ...then whatever happens afterwards is determined by you because the whole issue was brought up by you. And we are still currently 50/50 and so...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And so, don&#39;t say &quot;He said no&quot;. I didn&#39;t say no to anything in the over... trying to overtake Rowboat which... I&#39;m kind of upset with. I mean, I can&#39;t believe you would say that. I would... I mean...</p><p><strong>LG confirms that he has been doing same minimal work for last 7 years because JZ wouldn't give up ownership then.</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You couldn&#39;t believe that I had said that seven years ago. You couldn&#39;t believe that probably five years before that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I know. Still can&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what to tell you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How do you. How do you feel... What leads you to not only have that thought, but to say that out loud to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How do you feel that you deserve more than 50?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think that it&#39;s a part of it is is positioned as to workload. I think part of it...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean if. If we are trying to get workload off you and you say no. Who&#39;s fault is that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not saying no. I&#39;m saying that that wasn&#39;t a main driver to that.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the worldâ€™s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-mp3-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your mp3 files to text">Automatically convert your mp3 files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="collaboration tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/collaborate-with-teams?utm_source=embed">collaboration tools</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="enterprise-grade admin tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/admin-tools?utm_source=embed">enterprise-grade admin tools</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="share transcripts" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/share-and-publish?utm_source=embed">share transcripts</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="world-class support" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/world-class-support?utm_source=embed">world-class support</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
