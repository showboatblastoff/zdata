And it pulls it all out.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And the first thing I was finding was some of the costs of goods were so shockingly high. And then for us to make, like, nothing on it. We were just, like, shoveling money to the distributors to sit and wait and, uh, on, on product. But, uh, I mean. Those were. Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So I mean, I thats the thing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I understand the logic of, you know, when, when you&#39;re hungry, you, you start grabbing anything that&#39;s in front of you. And it makes sense. But it&#39;s more...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not about looking at that top number. We got to start concentrating on... because I found I found a bunch of jobs that were shockingly, shockingly, uh, profitable ones that ones that are that pass through our doors that were just like, &quot;oh, whatever. Oh, that got done? I didn&#39;t even see it.&quot; There is quite a few of those. But no, I agree. I didn&#39;t mean to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No, I want I definitely want to, um, here, I&#39;ll share my screen so we can just pop in. Um, no, I definitely want your feedback because that&#39;s that&#39;s I don&#39;t want to just talk at you guys. Like, I want to talk with you guys. Um, so. Um. That&#39;s great. To drill into like by project and by client. Like obviously I want we want to see that. And I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got it going back. I didn&#39;t mean to cut you off. I got it going back to 2019 so we could look at our what we considered the good years and what was going on and figure out how to recreate the the golden years.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Absolutely. What changed and things like that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah</p><p><strong>JZ went back and recategorized every order to make uniform, so books work correctly</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So I think that&#39;s super important. And definitely one of the things that I found, you know, was happening as if I, if I were to look in here and look at, like your products and services and the way that it&#39;s things were, mapping in, in your accounting.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!, fiduciary, no-financial,</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So I&#39;m sure that you have your, like, what you guys use to, kind of look at things and to get, get kind of like a feel for the health of the business and stuff like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re, if you guys were doing that or if you were, like, relying on your financials to kind of tell you that story? But, you know, going forward, now that you have spark with you, you would want to be relying on your kind of financials to be telling you that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And a lot of these things like where these product, details were mapping to weren&#39;t... it wasn&#39;t really, coordinating to like what the description was or what the item was.

And that, I mean...</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>cog, fiduciary, self-serving, suzanne</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I came across so many that were so high priced for, like, Dyson and a couple other places like that where the turnaround, it was like we were paying $40 for the item. And then charging them like $44, you know, and it was like, whoa, that is so high.

Yeah.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>ripple, lg-plan, self-serving, suzanne</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah, I get it. But it&#39;s like we can only charge so much for embroidery. So, you know, I saw a bunch that had these coats that were like, you know, over 100 something dollars each. And we did like $2 of embroidery on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which I, I get you got to take the little jobs with the big jobs. And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s because or we&#39;re taking these jobs, there&#39;s a bigger picture. Like, you know, a lot of people give us garbage, tiny jobs, in order to string us along for the big ones.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>ripple
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And and I get we&#39;re always trying to take as much as we can, but what I&#39;ve been doing over the last two weeks is I&#39;m working on a new platform to try to drive sales from the broader base of... online customers. Sorry. My screen just went off.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got it streamlined. It&#39;s I&#39;m really understanding the APIs and pushing stuff back and forth and scraping the info, and I&#39;ve been running all the queries.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s awesome. I could actually pull up, a sales person, the year and look at how they, they did per customer.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And like, you could put different... it builds like little charts against themselves. But...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />With all this automation and stuff, I think that if we get away from it being sales based, in that someone has to go woo a giant customer to make it monthly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean that that&#39;s a lot of the reason we&#39;re in the trouble we&#39;re in now, which I 1,000% get when someone&#39;s got the money out in front of you, you take it. And well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />That&#39;s not so. That&#39;s kind of the the opposite of what I&#39;m saying. So I, I, I don&#39;t want you to just take anything that walks or strolls by you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, we don&#39;t, we want to get away from that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And the way I think to do that is with this online system where as people find us, that&#39;s more revenue making its way to us in a general way, because that&#39;s the way they find everyone else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not like there&#39;s, you know, Culture has some hotshot guy who goes and recruits every customer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s, you know, just online portals and this and that. And if we have that running in the background, you know, anything big on top of it is just cake.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I have a whole system with that and I got it, I got it now where the emails that come in from Future Shirts automatically turn into an invoice with their exact pricing and everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, and it could API back into their system so we don&#39;t have to play with their their system is goofy. So I&#39;m going to talk to Carmel about plugging into theirs, and it&#39;ll be killer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, I&#39;ve also figured out how to get into the messaging in Printavo. So when you want to message a customer, it goes through the Printavo messaging, bypassing any phone numbers or any of that kind of stuff. And it&#39;s all trackable in the job, like going back. But I mean, I...

SM states JZ's automation and analysis data is going to be enormous</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I... yeah, I definitely think that you&#39;re automation work is going to be enormous, and I think that&#39;s the way that everybody&#39;s going towards.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And I think that you should definitely, continue to move forward with the automations and things like that. And, and that&#39;s awesome. Like, I think that that is, definitely the way to go.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And you want to continue to pursue that. But what I want you guys to also take a look at is like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />For those projects where that you mentioned, where it&#39;s like, you know, the North Face jackets, and the embroidery on it. So that would be almost the equivalent of the customer supplying the garments, like you&#39;re not making a markup on the garment</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Or the apparel like, so you would want to start like separating that out into, like customer supplied garment or something to that effect, or even have the customer, you know, their card is charged for the North Face stuff, since it&#39;s such a pass through to you in terms of profitability.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And so it&#39;s things like that where you&#39;re like, okay, so if we if, if the cost for, the North Face jackets and the, you know, the resale price for them are basically just a pass through and we&#39;re not making any money on this, this aspect of it.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />We&#39;re going to look at this, you know, revenue stream. As you know, the goods are supplied by the, the client and it&#39;s just the in-house embroidery service or whatever.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So what is that like, how much money are we making on that? How, um, lean are we running on that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Spark employee overheard: </strong><br />What&#39;s the production turnaround time like the cost for that? Is it, you know, outsource whatever. And then that&#39;s how you lean into the profitability of that job was because the Colas are a pass through like right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />The garment, it&#39;s not even there. And you could actually have your client. You could be like, here&#39;s, we need your card...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />North Face is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You&#39;re paying for this.
