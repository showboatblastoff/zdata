Um, I know I worked in it. I know of it, but screen printing is my my baby.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Awesome. All right, cool. Um, but yeah, so I guess just to jump in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So as far as the account, so we had a fraud situation with the bank. And so what we had to do was transfer everything to basically the old 4700 account, the other savings account. And I think there was one other checking account, right? There were three accounts. Um, they all</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The PPP account, 9710 account.</p><p><strong>LG states on 2023-02-09  in text that he only has a chase personal account

on 2023-02-14 LG says his Fifth third personal account is what made it set up so fast
Lucas did sign up for a new account 1 week before the account was closed</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea the PPP account. So those all closed as of last Friday, Thursday on the ninth. So that might have been when you saw those.

So basically what we&#39;ve been doing since since then is regrouping with Fifth Third to everything had to be shifted out of that in a cashier&#39;s check or multiple cashier&#39;s checks to be put into what is now the current, uh, the business one.

The only reason that I don&#39;t so I don&#39;t have a communal login to be able to share because the only, the quickest way that they could do it was to tie it to I have a personal account that that is there. So right now what I&#39;ve been trying to deal with them this morning is trying to get them to still separate that because we don&#39;t the fifth third direct is still not active like if you even go and I mean you can log into Fifth Third Direct but it still just has the last three accounts and everything is zeroed out on there as well.

So I&#39;ve been working with them to try to get not only Fifth Third Direct set back up so that we can send out wires, but also so that you can have access to that and so that the separation of both the personal and then the business one.

So the main focus for us was just to make sure that one, we could get that money out and into something because luckily payroll was last Tuesday. We have payroll coming up this Tuesday. So we just wanted to make sure that everything was shifted around as quickly as possible so that we could we could do that because as of now, mean today is the first somewhat functional day that we at least see the balance that was deposited in there as a pending balance.

We had to also reroute all of the credit card to be deposited into the new account too. And so that took some time. And so in the interim it was with card connect or card point, and now we had to jump to Stripe to be able to do that kind of very quickly.

So that&#39;s at least active as of right now. We saw the first deposit into the account from Stripe this morning and there was a couple others that people either processed yesterday and those are being deposited from what it says right now on Stripe on Friday. So it&#39;s just a little bit of a juggling act right now. But I think our main focus has just been, one, making sure that we&#39;re operable so that payroll can be made and then we&#39;ll continue to connect the rest of the dots.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. So yikes. That sounds like a stressful, stressful, frustrating time. And this isn&#39;t the first time this has happened, right? Isn&#39;t that happening?</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the world’s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-m4a-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your m4a files to text">Automatically convert your m4a files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automated subtitles" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/automated-subtitles?utm_source=embed">automated subtitles</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="generate automated summaries powered by AI" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/automated-summaries?utm_source=embed">generate automated summaries powered by AI</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="transcribe multiple languages" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/languages?utm_source=embed">transcribe multiple languages</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="share transcripts" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/share-and-publish?utm_source=embed">share transcripts</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
