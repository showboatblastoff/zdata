Okay, so, yeah, maybe just. Let&#39;s consolidate. I have to I have to follow up with them later.

But, um, he was calling me this weekend, so if you think they&#39;re done today, then I&#39;ll at least give them the heads up that they can either pick up by the end of the day or tomorrow morning.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Okay, cool.

Is that still a thing?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I believe so, but I haven&#39;t they haven&#39;t said anything more about that. So I&#39;d rather just let&#39;s get the other ones out of our hair and then, um, see what that one takes next. But they haven&#39;t said anything yet about those.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />They&#39;re like angsty. You know, I&#39;ve been listening to a lot of, uh, like, pop punk lately, and I bet you those guys listen to that, too.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They&#39;re like a meld of of, like, pop punk, but also like the weird, like, down and dirty like trap, like garbage hip hop. I don&#39;t it&#39;s a weird demographic.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Yeah, they do that thing where they just kind of like, they dance like this for, like, for sure. I know some of the people and they&#39;re good people, but some of them are not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah. Did... did Pat tell me that you were, like, hanging out with one of them or something? Someone&#39;s girlfriend or some shit?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Oh, I, uh, yeah. Well, um. Uh, my brother&#39;s girlfriend, uh, she&#39;s a she&#39;s an artist. Um. And she talks to a lot of people like this. You know, I guess she knows the guy.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />And I was like, because. Because I was like talking shit a little bit to my brother. And he was like, oh yeah, fuck that dude. I heard some weird shit. So I was talking to her and he... and she was like, uh, yeah, he&#39;s a fucking prick and shit. Like, I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think she knows him like that well or anything like that, but she knows him in the scene and stuff like that. And I guess he is pretty young too, which makes sense.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />He&#39;s super young.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Yeah, okay. For sure, I thought. Yeah, that&#39;s what I was thinking when I heard of all the weird stuff that was happening. I&#39;m like, sounds like he&#39;s 20 years old, not knowing what to do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh for sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Um, but yeah. No, she was talking shit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s hilarious.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Uh, people. Oh, I also keep, like, on the street. I will just see that three, three, three from a mile away. I&#39;m like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right. What&#39;s his name? Uh, Mike&#39;s guy wears it every day, and I&#39;m not exaggerating. Literally every single day. He&#39;s wearing Half Evil stuff, almost. But he&#39;s... he works in the building behind where Sam used to live, so I, I assume that they just know each other and he just hooks him up or something.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Oh. Funny stuff. All right. Um. Uh. Tim. Tim. Tim. Montana. Finished. Uh, toothpick game. All finished. Spark&#39;d is ready to go, just gotta make some labels. Um. Oh. Brand Addition.

So, Lucas, I actually have two different Nokia Brand Edition hat orders. They&#39;re both complete. Uh, is it cool to ship them together? I think everything&#39;s the same.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You can... I think you can ship them together. I would just make sure that if there&#39;s some way to either have a sticker on the box that has obviously the separate POs, so like, don&#39;t gang box them together, box them separate. And then whether it&#39;s on the label or a separate label, just to have a sticker that shows their PO, because that&#39;s the way. I mean, I was I was running into them last week because they were they were saying that they didn&#39;t receive a bunch of stuff, but it was in another thing. So it just becomes a bigger problem around with how they have to process their invoices.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />All right. Cool. Yeah. I&#39;ll just label them like a regular order and then just ship them together.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />So there&#39;s no confusion. Cool. Let&#39;s go. Um, SNS stuff. In English. Uh, constellation. Oh, the summer stuff. A big old note here. What the hell did I say? A whole shebang until we receive and delete the remaining pieces. Boom. So whenever those show up, we&#39;ll see those ship. Carhartt tees, finished. Future Shirts Mount Joy.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Mount Joy is getting more creative with their designs, I must say. Well done on their part.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah those designs are getting cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Very cool actually, I don&#39;t know who the artist was I still haven&#39;t looked it up, but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s some country stuff, but the designs are pretty cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think it is actually. I think they actually, I think they&#39;re they&#39;re more of like a, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re more like jammy because we, we had done stuff with them before Future Shirts.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s a... and they&#39;re supposed to be big. That&#39;s right. Someone saw the Mount Joy thing in our photos or something was like, oh, you guys do them? I was like, who are they? That&#39;s right. Yeah, we did do them before.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I think it&#39;s more like indie rock.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Okay. Church the King. We are...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />heh heh</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />We&#39;re waiting for (unheard). I know you ordered that last.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />I better get.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Some of it was coming from New York. They&#39;re just getting super slow with sending their stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />For sure. Yeah, it seems to be like a freaking three days to, like, a week.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, or so I&#39;ve ordered it. And then it&#39;ll just be the next day.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Right? Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But it just depends on what they have in Illinois, I guess. Because a lot of it&#39;s in New York.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />And so we finished. Uh, Neil Francis. Finished. Spark&#39;d. That&#39;s another Spark&#39;d. It&#39;s finished. Just gotta make some labels. Pipeworks. We still haven&#39;t received hats from them. Let&#39;s do the 26th.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah that&#39;s fine. I mean, that can that can shift their, um, their sourcing in the hat. So I think as soon as they maybe just give me a heads up whenever they do and I&#39;ll just, I&#39;ll slide back their, their in hands date, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s kind of in their court right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Okay. Cool. There&#39;s like there&#39;s hands ready to make it, you know. So it&#39;ll be it&#39;ll be a pretty quick turn over, I&#39;d say. Um. Let&#39;s see. Steppenwolf. Um, uh, we talked about that tea. That&#39;ll be here probably the next day or two. Uh. Uh. Ludwig.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Ludwig.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Uh, finished.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Those look cool. That that was weird. That photographic drum was strange.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah. It was, it turned out like a good it&#39;s a I don&#39;t know what it is and why I think it&#39;s so cool, but it&#39;s a very cool print.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I couldn&#39;t understand the colors and why they did that and but it made sense.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Oh, you mean like the gray compared to, like, the white.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. And the... yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />So I am like &quot;why don&#39;t you just make it one color?&quot; Then they printed it, I was like, yeah, I don&#39;t know why its so cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah it did come out cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />That guy was cool. I talked to him. He was like, uh. He said, yeah, we&#39;re happy to find somebody local. Yeah. I&#39;m like, awe yeah its...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because where where are they?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Um, I believe they are produced in Chicago.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah. No, but do you know, like, the actual location?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />I&#39;m not sure, I don&#39;t know. Can&#39;t be too far. You can&#39;t pick them up, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah, they have offices. I mean, their main offices are in North Carolina. Um, but I don&#39;t know what they the kind of all over the place.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Got you. Yeah. My brother said that there&#39;s some kind of. One thing I think happening soon in Chicago.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, they have they have some event. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve been talking for a long time and that&#39;s why all of a sudden they were just like, shit, let&#39;s just do it now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Nice. Yeah, that&#39;s cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Lets see. There&#39;s that other hat thing. Peak Six. Everything else we&#39;re waiting for goods. Playa Society. These dope ass fucking NBA t&#39;s very cool. Um, I think those are going to arrive today.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, their blanks you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Yes, I think there&#39;s some. Is it customer? It is customer. Yeah. There&#39;s some kind of weird. It&#39;s a whole bunch of boxes. I bet it&#39;s that one.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay Yeah, I&#39;m trying to. They&#39;re I mean, they&#39;re they&#39;re newer, so I&#39;m trying to handhold them through the best way to keep it organized. So let me know. They should have the blank that come in. It should have either their order number or they don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think they have their specific PO on there, but it should have our order number just so that it started correctly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Love it. Um. Let&#39;s see. There was The Heavy tour posters. I guess those are probably just going to be, like, repackaged and sent.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, they should be, um, when they, when M13 sends them, they should be. They should be blind. But I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any other stuff in there, but.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Oh that&#39;s right yeah I remember. Oh I think it was, it was probably for The Heavy too. Yeah. It was like a dope... I remember the guy came in, he was like, wow, this is a really nice packaging job. I&#39;m like, yep, that&#39;s what we do here. Oh, yeah. Um, Aeriz stuff.It says that&#39;ll be cool. It&#39;ll be like those freaking... those bags with the patches and stuff. That&#39;s always a good, production task.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, that&#39;s the biggest, um... so the shoulder bags, um, everything is ordered from Stahl&#39;s already. Um, it&#39;s still going to be about a month out. Um, until we get that PVC patch. Howard still needs to go in, but I&#39;m just waiting because it&#39;s still going to be a month anyway. But, um. Let&#39;s see. Yeah. Everything else, it&#39;s all reorder stuff. Um, but the majority of it is coming from overseas.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />Oh yea? Double Elvis. Sounds fun.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Double Elvis? That&#39;s funny.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They&#39;re really big on podcasts. Um, I&#39;ve known this guy for a handful of years now, but I keep trying to do merch and not doing merch, so this is their first entry in it, but it&#39;s.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />The Church. Nonpoint stuff. That&#39;s... oh, not too big. And Umamique</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Umamique</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />That sounds good.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>!</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Um. I&#39;m trying to sort out date for him. They have something coming up with WGN, so they&#39;re trying to get a couple a couple samples if we don&#39;t do just the full run of it. But I gotta figure out how to how to guide that if we&#39;re going to do it, I think. Um, just because so Monday will be Memorial Day, so we&#39;ll lose that day. Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Let&#39;s see.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Jeff Paolino: </strong><br />I forgot about that. That&#39;s pretty cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. So just want to make sure everybody knows that. Um, but Memorial Day, I think the only other things...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So Filberto... and we gotta, I guess, however, we want to address trying to figure out how we can keep an eye on what&#39;s going on overtime wise. Because we have... so the next either...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We could talk about this later, Lucas. We&#39;ll talk later about this, Lucas. This is not to be need to be addressed with Filiberto. You and I could talk about this later.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. So in general, I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You and I could talk about this later.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The orders that we have right now that are either leading up to what I&#39;d say next week, I think I just want to keep aware that the kind of the wave of what&#39;s happening right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Thanks for listening.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So and Filiberto, I know you and I have talked about this anyway, but...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />First of all, I&#39;d like to address Lucas. You could, you could address me. You do not work directly with Filiberto. Is that understood? Do you understand that? I&#39;m asking you a question.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m gonna hop off, guys. Um, so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So do you understand? You just reach out to Filberto whenever you want without talking to me? Is that how it works?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, yes. I discuss things with.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, okay. Well that ends.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay all right, guys, um, I&#39;ll hop off, but, um. Yeah, I just mainly want to just keep conscious of what&#39;s kind of going on, at least industry wise, and the ups and downs.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah we got it. We&#39;ll talk later, Lucas.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There are just some things that we want to keep conscious of. So, um, yeah, I&#39;ll catch up with you guys outside of that, but I think things are fine right now. But I mean, it&#39;s kind of a unanimous thing of what&#39;s happening through even with other facilities. Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Could you shut up? Just shut up. Just stop. Stop.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Industry-wise. Um, so I&#39;ll address those guys with you separately.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, you you will not. You will not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Apologize for the erratic behavior, but we&#39;ll, um. I&#39;ll catch up with you guys.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay? So we all understand what&#39;s going on here. You you don&#39;t want to follow rules and make things very bizarre for everyone. This is why I got to jump in here. That is why.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. All right, guys, I&#39;ll catch up with you.
