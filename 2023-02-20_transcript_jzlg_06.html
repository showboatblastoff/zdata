I mean... in the end, I don&#39;t know what I could do here. I mean, I get on here saying my answer is yes to everything. I want to make this work.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You say it&#39;s about workload, which is something we&#39;ve been breaking down for a long time. We talk about it, then you say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Workload is workload.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then we come back and you say, &quot;Well, because of workload, I deserve more than 50%.&quot; Is that.....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s... there&#39;s a hole there that is pretty clear.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>recording acknowledgement
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But because it&#39;s only you and me, this video, whatever you&#39;re recording makes no difference because you&#39;re the only one holding yourself responsible to anything.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>LG points out why he doesn't agree with 50/50
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />100%. And I mean, that&#39;s also the worst part about having a 50% business and the two partner business is the fact that there is nobody else to be able to say, okay. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />When it&#39;s two people that respect each other and know that the person that they&#39;re talking to is intelligent and remembers things, when you have that mutual respect, you can have that back and forth. But when it becomes a game it is only  completely apparent to an outside viewer. And which is why I would love for us to have the lawyers involved in everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, that&#39;s fine. But what do you think that they&#39;re going to say? They don&#39;t know the history.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know anything. I mean, this is brought up by you. You&#39;re saying, what are you against.. Now against getting the lawyers?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, not at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then I&#39;m confused. You just said, What do you think they will say? Aren&#39;t we supposed to talk to them?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m just saying that in your position and I&#39;m not looking for you to give me a definitive decision right now. But if you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re not in a position, nor will you ever be in a position to say that I would discuss or agree on any structure other than 5050 then that to me...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, see, that&#39;s a completely different conversation. And why does this become:

(JZ mimicking a proclamation) &quot;in no way, shape or form...&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />and if you say, &quot;hey, this guy&#39;s got $10 million, he says, if we each sign on for 2% and and don&#39;t fucking come anywhere near it for the next ten years, do you want to do it?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You think (JZ mimics a goofy voice) &quot;Nope. Remember I said 50-50?&quot;

I mean, it&#39;s insulting. I mean, if you&#39;re trying to just get me to say stuff that&#39;s ridiculous,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Im not at all. I&#39;m not and I&#39;m telling you that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You did. You jump to... &quot;You just said never will you ever be happy with anything besides 5050.&quot; And none of those words ever came from my mouth. My mouth said, if you are currently asking me if you&#39;re currently asking me that for more than 50%, the answer would be I&#39;m not happy with that. That is my answer to that one specific question.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. And I respect that. My only question is, so where does it leave the conversation?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. This is you. This is you. You threw..you drew.... This whole thing could be withdrawn by you and move forward by you. I&#39;m here. I&#39;m listening.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I&#39;m just. And the only. I&#39;m not telling you to this to give me an answer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />This whole conversation is bizarre. I mean, because you. You told me what you thought. I said, Okay, let&#39;s do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Let&#39;s do with the lawyers and everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And then it&#39;s, &quot;Whoa, what do you want to do?&quot; I, I don&#39;t know. I just agreed.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just agreeing with everything you say and in not to.. not to just get you off the phone, but because I can work with you with anyone. And I want to make everything amicable. I mean, I don&#39;t. I have no problems with you, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, but do you understand why I&#39;m just saying that that ... short of you just saying &quot;Cool. No problem. We can agree on whatever structure that you would like or we both agree on.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Short of..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I, the answer is I will never change anything from 50% unless it is a purchase situation or obviously. But if it&#39;s just you and me and no one other no one else involved, then no way, man. No way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. That&#39;s... you&#39;re entitled to that decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, but what if I came to you and said the same thing?

(JZ roleplays with roles reversed)
&quot;I want more than 50%. I&#39;m here in Chicago with all of production. I&#39;m managing all of this. I&#39;m handling all of this. You&#39;re only taking care of yourself. I want more.&quot;

What would your answer be? Go fuck yourself? or sure?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No.I feel like I would say if you feel that you&#39;re entitled to that, then that&#39;s a discussion to have. But clearly what you see as my value to the business...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ve said that I feel both our values are equal, which is why I think it should be 50/50. I 1,000% understand: &quot;No Lucas Guariglia, No Rowboat Creative.&quot; I 1,000% understand that. The same way I understand: &quot;No Joe Zangrilli, No Rowboat Creative.&quot;

And did it take a couple of streetwise knuckleheads to push forward whatever this machine is that we built? Yes, it did. And are we here because we&#39;re knuckleheads? Yes, we are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I just never thought I&#39;d see the day where this would happen between two friends.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But we&#39;ve had this conversation before.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, I know. And I was upset then too. So us say having the conversation before doesn&#39;t make it any better. But I mean, you&#39;re entitled to your own thoughts. And I... I mean, I&#39;m not just gonna roll over and do that after I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t expect you to do that, and I wouldn&#39;t expect you to do that, but part of...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then what are you talking about? I mean, is it workload? Is it the amount of the business you own?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All of.. it&#39;s all of... it&#39;s all of them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. So the answer is you don&#39;t want to work with me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t feel like it is a sustainable business and or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay and I get that. So moving the conversation forward, you can&#39;t work with me is what you&#39;re saying.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I find it extremely difficult to work with you. I find it extremely difficult for me to move past what has been past, which is its own work in itself, but also the feelings of feeling that the equity is shifted.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I feel like the equity shifted a long time ago and I understand your position. I don&#39;t expect you just to say, cool, whatever you want to do is whatever you want to do, because that&#39;s not the way that those conversations go. I was not looking for...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to.... hear what you&#39;re having to say. It is the fact that I consider what we built &quot;ours&quot;, and I don&#39;t feel either of us is more important or could ever be more important than each other in this situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I would I would agree. However, I would say that moving forward, I don&#39;t... that&#39;s... whether that was moving forward for me seven years ago or moving forward for me now, I feel like that is why I don&#39;t feel comfortable with it. Just as much as you don&#39;t feel comfortable changing it..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it, but then the answer is we got to do something because we&#39;re just racking up more shit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I&#39;m not saying come up with a date or anything, I&#39;m just saying that&#39;s the next step. But you clearly don&#39;t want to work with me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m trying to do everything I can to address the issues, but... I mean, if when we go to address each issue, we say each issue doesn&#39;t matter. But then the issue comes right back as the reason, it...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They all.. they all matter. I&#39;m not saying they don&#39;t matter. I&#39;m saying that they&#39;re all drivers of the larger issue.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, and in the end it all, unless I could change myself into someone else from...  short of being able to do that, what I&#39;m hearing is &quot;goodbye.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t have a solve. I&#39;m just my conversation was saying, Dude, here&#39;s my issues.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I hear.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the world’s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-mp3-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your mp3 files to text">Automatically convert your mp3 files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="enterprise-grade admin tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/admin-tools?utm_source=embed">enterprise-grade admin tools</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="share transcripts" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/share-and-publish?utm_source=embed">share transcripts</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="world-class support" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/world-class-support?utm_source=embed">world-class support</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="transcribe multiple languages" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/languages?utm_source=embed">transcribe multiple languages</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
