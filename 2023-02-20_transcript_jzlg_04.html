So then what&#39;s another one?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think liability. There&#39;s nothing not only legally that protects me, there&#39;s nothing. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There is. We have LLC, but... I don&#39;t... What are you talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s not. Because part of the other part of the bank situation is the fact that that has potential to now be reported to other banks, which I don&#39;t care about on the Rowboat side of that, but for any future endeavors of me that I cannot be attached to anything like that. And if that has...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not following.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />&quot;Anything like that?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />A bank account is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m literally just trying to have you specify what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s like business credit. So if that&#39;s in a permanent file, then any sort of relationship that I continue to build outside of Rowboat that is saying, okay, that&#39;s fine, I&#39;d like to open a business account with whoever.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t are you saying you don&#39;t want to be on a bank account with me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m just using that as an example of the current most recent bank situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which is turning out to be fraud. But let&#39;s carry on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. There&#39;s... It doesn&#39;t matter. The... the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It does matter. It does matter. So if you&#39;re mad at me for shooting someone and it turns out I&#39;d never shot them, could you still be mad at me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, but you are...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But it&#39;s always something? Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, it is. And you are half of the business that is a reflection of half of the business. And there is nothing to insulate me from that and or beyond...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Fine, I mean until.. Then we can&#39;t be in a business together because you think I&#39;m a liability, which is fine then. I mean, there&#39;s nothing to argue about. So there&#39;s the liability issue. Then what else is there? I mean, because that&#39;s irreconcilable and I don&#39;t really understand, but. Okay. What else is there besides the liability?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t understand how you couldn&#39;t understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What&#39;s that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Think thats there.. I don&#39;t understand how you couldn&#39;t understand that if I was. I&#39;m the complete flip side of that. You don&#39;t think that would be in question on you or anybody else? Or if there was a third party?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, I want the third party here because there&#39;s a reality to this conversation. We need it. Our lack of any one.. Any accountability for anything you say has what led us to where we are and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Any accountability? Are you saying that I can&#39;t support you being a liability?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah. Yes, definitely.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, there&#39;s I don&#39;t want to continue working with you if it&#39;s like this, but no one&#39;s forcing you to stay working with me. But what are we going to do about our bills? Nothing?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because if the answer is nothing, then I got to do something on my end here.. not.. to to save, to make.. to get money coming in here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, isn&#39;t that our job to keep the business running?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, And that has been the job. And that&#39;s been the stress of the job for the last two weeks as I&#39;ve continued to do that. This is where the conversation goes, and this is where...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know... It&#39;s me listening and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s you being. It&#39;s it&#39;s you being you and it&#39;s it&#39;s every part of why don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t care about this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t need to turn over this will never go to a Supreme Court. It has nothing to do with saying okay great show your evidence.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not fighting you on anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re interrupting me is what you continue to do too..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I apologize.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...and every step of the way. If a partner on the other side of it says, I see you as a liability to the business, I have no insulation to that. I don&#39;t want any any interaction with that affecting not only the business that I&#39;m currently in and or any future businesses.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is no action for that right now. That is a legal thing that has to be taken care of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p><strong>LG states wants more ownership of RBC 5 days after account closed and new ones opened without JZ name on them</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Beyond the workload, which is nothing beyond dividing up things and trying to I&#39;m not concerned about that. Workload is workload. The value I think of our positions has been skewed and that is a conversation that I&#39;ve had multiple times with you. And whether wanna say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Skewed?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...you want to say bring up the past, whether you want</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, we&#39;re 50/50.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are saying you should be paid more than me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not only does it result to the the payment amount, I think that the equity alone, based on the value of the business, should be different.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I think that the structure of the business should be different no matter what, because that is also when more decisions unrelated to having a 50/50 conversation that never, never goes anywhere because we can never agree on anything that that&#39;s a conversation that I specifically did try to have seven years ago.</p><p><strong>actually otherway around, LG was the one who said FU you can have it all. Link here:
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And your response was, Fuck you, you can have it all. And that&#39;s where that conversation stopped. And so, yes, there&#39;s continued resentment that has built from that from a long time ago. That is still the situation. And I put it under the rug for a long time thinking things will get better. But it hasn&#39;t gotten better. And I think that that&#39;s a very valid conversation to have with any sort of partnership, regardless of one person, two people or five people. Okay. And I and again, I think that that&#39;s not a conversation that we&#39;re capable of because I&#39;ve tried to have it multiple conversations and it hasn&#39;t worked.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry. Hang on. There&#39;s... a train went by. Sorry. I couldn&#39;t hear you. All right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So I&#39;m assuming that your position is still the same position and you don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which is? Which is what? My answer was. I said, I&#39;m saying yes to anything. Everything is yes. So, I mean, I have zero position. My position is to make every day better. That&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m trying to do. And if.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes is not a is not an answer to that, nor was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not fighting you on anything. So if you say, let&#39;s talk to lawyers, let&#39;s get the lawyers, then they&#39;ll tell us what the next steps are. I don&#39;t even know what else to do besides that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If that was the one issue that we turned over to them, they are going to say, okay, so what... That conversation</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know and that&#39;s where I&#39;m... I mean, because this is on your end. I mean, how do we make whatever you want happen happen?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s a conversation that either happens or it doesn&#39;t happen because I tried to have it seven years ago and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I said, let&#39;s have it now. And there&#39;s there&#39;s no conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You feel like that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Please don&#39;t tell me what I feel. Please don&#39;t tell me what I feel or what you think.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m asking you. That was the beginning of a question before you interrupted me. You feel like that&#39;s unfounded?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Feel like what is unfounded?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You feel like me saying that the current structure.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the worldâ€™s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-mp3-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your mp3 files to text">Automatically convert your mp3 files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-mp3-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert mp3 to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automatic transcription software" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed">automatic transcription software</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="generate automated summaries powered by AI" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/automated-summaries?utm_source=embed">generate automated summaries powered by AI</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="world-class support" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/world-class-support?utm_source=embed">world-class support</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="collaboration tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/collaborate-with-teams?utm_source=embed">collaboration tools</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
