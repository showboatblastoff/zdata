</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. Um, no, I mean, knowing that is good. I mean, I think because it&#39;s not like that&#39;s an ongoing thing. But now knowing that, I think if it comes up, I&#39;ll just make sure that you&#39;re at least in the loop and saying, Hey, here&#39;s. Even before we do anything to say, here&#39;s what they&#39;re asking. Like, is this something that we want to do? I think my mentality at the end of the year is just, okay, sure, if you want to float some money in there, then then great, we&#39;re floating some money.

But um, the only so another situation that we or a conversations that I&#39;ve had with them is they have sometimes they&#39;re not able to specifically sponsor or to pay specific vendors for something. So let&#39;s say that they&#39;re going to pay whatever $5,000 to us and they want to pay $4,000 to sponsor something else. They can&#39;t specifically hand over that money to that client. So it&#39;s not like we&#39;re we&#39;re not laundering it, but like it transactionally, they&#39;re trying to put it through us to be able to pay those vendors. Is that like, how would that scenario ever or is that just something we just talk through when it because every time they brought it up, I&#39;m confused and I&#39;m like, sure, whatever. We&#39;ll just talk about it when it happens and figure out what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Has it happened before? How have you guys done it for them?</p><p><strong>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gjhL-jPJnWeCiuc10jHq6oKgnQ6L-5uw&usp=drive_fs
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Okay. Um, yeah. So basically it&#39;s it&#39;s like a pass through moment where you would have like an item on your invoice to them that&#39;s essentially like zero markup, like because or, you know, zero margin because you&#39;re going to invoice them for something and then you&#39;re going to turn around and give it all to somebody else and you&#39;re not going to make like a profit on it. And so if you&#39;re like, if you&#39;re truly like, job costing and we&#39;re like doing real like project reporting and stuff like that, we would see that, you know, the hats or whatever for this company. You know, you had a 35% markup margin on it and then, you know, your service was price of this and you made this and that on this project. But then when it comes to that line item, there was no profit on it because you shouldn&#39;t profit on hat part of it, you know what I mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />So it was just a pass through moment where they needed you to receive the money and then pay it out to the like promoter person or the, you know, donation, the charitable contribution that it gets.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>very interested in a hypothetical
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, yeah. I mean, do I think I&#39;m, I&#39;m thinking even like, so in that last transaction then it what do we have to do? Like are we then 1099 that person because technically, you know, let&#39;s say just for easy numbers, it&#39;s $5,000. They want to do $4,500 worth of hats that were then going to give to that thing. And they also want to donate $500 to that organization if it&#39;s all coming through us. And ultimately, if we&#39;re handing over a check for a payment, then what? Like, what does that even look like? And is that over complicating and opening us up for like, are they just circumventing all the other tax stuff to deal with?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yeah, I was kind of wondering what their reason was that they like, why can&#39;t you pay a charity? But um, you like, what did they do? But, um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s because. It&#39;s because they can&#39;t. They specifically, like, they&#39;re not allowed to, I think, because of their distribution or how they&#39;re a distributor. They can&#39;t legally, like Goose Island couldn&#39;t just say, Hey, we&#39;re giving this bar, you know, $10,000 because it&#39;s not. It&#39;s whatever. However it works in that world, they&#39;re not allowed to do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />Yea. Because of those laws. Yeah. So, um, you would 1099 like, um, whoever it&#39;s going to. Exactly. And that would be your pass through, like, so you received X amount of money and then you paid X amount of people for this and it all comes out in your tax return too. So like you would see, um, and whether or not they&#39;re 1099 eligible or not, like if are, um, you know, exempt for whichever reason, what the input and the output like what&#39;s offset um, is your, is your net revenue. So because it&#39;s a pass through because you have 5000 in and then you have 5000 out on the total project for Goose Island like that will net to zero. So you&#39;re not making money. So on your tax return, you&#39;ve reported 5000 in and then you&#39;ve reported 5000 out because you&#39;ve paid a charity donation foundation and that net zero.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />And so your business who has a tax return and so whether or not their 1099 eligible I love that you&#39;re thinking about 1099s and all that. So maybe we will. Maybe we won&#39;t. It depends on their entity status. But at the end of the day, your tax return will show that net wash where it&#39;s zero because you received and then you gave it away.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. All right. Yeah. I mean, I think we just want it when or if it comes up, then we&#39;ll just talk through it too. But I&#39;ve always been confused with that situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark Accounting: </strong><br />I would love to talk through that and just make sure that it&#39;s like on the level and that there&#39;s nothing being missed, but it should be just a pass through.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the world’s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-m4a-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your m4a files to text">Automatically convert your m4a files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-m4a-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert m4a to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="secure transcription and file storage" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/security?utm_source=embed">secure transcription and file storage</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="transcribe multiple languages" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/languages?utm_source=embed">transcribe multiple languages</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="share transcripts" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/share-and-publish?utm_source=embed">share transcripts</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="enterprise-grade admin tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/admin-tools?utm_source=embed">enterprise-grade admin tools</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
