I mean, everything everything that comes out of my mouth just reminds me of why I don&#39;t want to be part of this anyway. So it is what it is. If you change your mind. I&#39;m still here to work, but just let me know what you&#39;re doing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So beyond..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I can figure it out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...that part of it was the conversation that I was saying. So if I or you or anybody for that matter, is the driving factor in sales, you you feel like that is something as a 50/50 business that we are both splitting the revenue for something like that. If there are things if we have a guy, John Doe, that is out there doing $4 billion worth of sales, there&#39;s no incentive for him to continue doing that versus bringing in all of that as a 50/50 business business and we&#39;re both sharing in that? If you were if you were to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you weren&#39;t being paid to be the owner at the same time. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. That&#39;s fine. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, because your side that your working on, sales, involves money, what are what are my incentives? I get more production time? because I do better?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not even... I&#39;m just... I&#39;m.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just saying, everything that you bring in, I have to rise to the occasion to produce.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not necessarily at all. There&#39;s a lot that 100%. You do not have to even be involved in the conversations and or any of any part of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And you feel I shouldn&#39;t have any money of that either, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m just raising that as an element.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Just less? Just less?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t attribute any sort of proportion to it whatsoever.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But more than 50% would be coming out of my side. Correct? So I say less. Less is the ultimate goal. So you could have more.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You could say less or you could say more. It doesn&#39;t... It would be the same thing again if it was me sitting in a seat or if it was Jay sitting in a seat.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, there&#39;s two different things there. It&#39;s not the same because you get the profit from everything. That means you would be double dipping because then you&#39;d get profit off the shit that you just got paid on. Yeah, I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m bringing it up as an opportunity, and I&#39;m bringing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not an opportunity. Opportunity for me to make less because you don&#39;t want to have sales people?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Again for your Supreme Court case. There&#39;s no part of me or my record that has ever said anything about not wanting more salespeople. The driving factor of not having more salespeople is that there is no money to hire those salespeople.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Why?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I do the continued diligence of talking to those people meetings that you&#39;re not even involved in because there&#39;s no point to even continue to drive them further. They&#39;re eager to come work, but also what they&#39;re asking for is nothing that we&#39;re capable of paying right now, and we&#39;re also not capable of managing them. And part of that is a defining choice of mine to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t want to manage them because I don&#39;t want to attribute any more of my time than what is already attributed to this with the current reality of the business.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. Your answer is I want to do less and make more. Is that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, that literally is the crux.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If that&#39;s what you feel it is, then thats what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean. It can be boiled down to that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. Yes. Do I want more? Sure. Do I need to do less to get more? No.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>intent, lg-real, lg-plan, in-writing, wow</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Do I have and have I had opportunity in the past to say I could just go somewhere else and I could take everything that I do there and not have worry about all of this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you can&#39;t. You can&#39;t?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean, I can&#39;t?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you think I could just open a business and take all of Rowboat&#39;s customers?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t need to take any of Rowboat&#39;s customers.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You just said take what. You do over there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Take what I do. Yes. As me and my asset of tools. Yes. I don&#39;t need to take any one of them. Every single one of them that I create and I cultivate the relationship.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m capable of doing a million times over with different people and different states that have no attachment to us whatsoever.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>lg-real, in-writing, sleepless, entitled, wow, lg-plan</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You don&#39;t think that that&#39;s something that has not only that keeps me up for days to that why why would I have to not only deal with this and be stressed out with this and the relationship of this where I could probably go get a well-paying job for everything that I can bring in.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>jz-real</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I want you to. I want you to. No one is forcing you to stay here. If you&#39;re unhappy, go. It&#39;s...</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>lg-real, funny-to-lg</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />(laughing) Okay.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>irrecon, call-out, funny-2-lg</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, this is. What are you laughing about, man? I mean, this is an issue you brought up. What you&#39;re saying is irreconcilable on my end, and it just leaves us to say, hey, I mean, I don&#39;t know what to tell you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t leave us anywhere.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It leaves me still.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It leaves us....</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>unilateral, fiduciary, lg-plan, in-writing</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The decision is mine. And that&#39;s where it leaves me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No.And I have to sit here and run this thing to not knowing what&#39;s going on, right? And not knowing what I should be doing about my future. I just have to sit and wait until you tell me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, that&#39;s. I mean, that&#39;s another conversation that I&#39;ve asked you multiple times of what you can....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Can we talk about now instead of &quot;remember when we had this conversation back...?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What&#39;s your... I asked you. Okay. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What&#39;s your plan?

The business closes tomorrow. What&#39;s your plan?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;ll figure it out. I mean, this is my plan. It&#39;s sort of being stepped on right now, but I&#39;ll figure it out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you want me to have that conversation with you about what my options are so you could choose what you&#39;re going to do, that&#39;s not going to happen.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t worry about me. I mean, I&#39;m not following here. I mean, it&#39;s like there&#39;s issues, but when we talk about them, we can&#39;t.... they fall apart.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They&#39;re not falling apart. They&#39;re just irreconcilable. That&#39;s where they are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, yeah, the. You want more?

And unfortunately....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean you just decided to change the game out of nowhere.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />(JZ roleplaying as LG):

And the next thing of that probably still involves attorneys because and short of that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I say let&#39;s do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And your answer is, &quot;well, what are they going to say?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. You have to ask them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What outcome would be ideal for you? And I&#39;m not asking in an asshole way. I&#39;m being serious.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />An understanding of why I feel that way and understanding of, okay, maybe that makes sense and maybe it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I don&#39;t think in any sort of business conversation to say that it has anything to do with me feeling like this is a driving force to say that you&#39;re not an equal to me. I think that it&#39;s an understanding of why I would have these issues and why I would want to bring them to the table to discuss. And and that&#39;s all that I can ask.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We could we could discuss all of them except the 50%, because, I mean, that is the sole reason that I&#39;m part of this is because we are a team that&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And if we can&#39;t be a team, I don&#39;t want to be part of it. So it&#39;s not me being not agreeable. It&#39;s just that&#39;s not an option.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not saying. You&#39;re not being agreeable. I&#39;m saying you&#39;re entitled to that decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s your decision. And as a result of that decision becomes my choice of a decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And the other element of that, whether that&#39;s in a sales role for you or for me, regardless, is that&#39;s simply a bullet point on my list of saying it doesn&#39;t... it doesn&#39;t seem fair.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t seem right. I can hear your side. I can hear your reasoning. And ultimately, again, if you&#39;re not agreeable to it, then your not agreeable with it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Would we not agree? Would you sign on for trading every other month? You come here and run production and I get to do sales.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So we switch... so we switch off.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see that as where the role... I mean, that&#39;s that&#39;s a completely different thing of saying, okay, well now all of a sudden you want to jump into being a doctor versus not being a doctor. That&#39;s not what the roles have become and what the....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I only say this stuff to jolt you into thinking outside of, for yourself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just I think it&#39;s a ridiculous statement to make.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. And that&#39;s... exactly. I feel the exact same way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s what you do, though. It&#39;s not just to say come in a role and say that&#39;s what you do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I could do. I do sales, too, and I crushed it. I did all sorts of sales. But what I&#39;m getting at is... I&#39;m merely pointing out that if you were to look at it from my side, I think you&#39;d be upset.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I would say the same thing. So it&#39;s the same stalemate of 15 years now?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m not the one judging each other&#39;s value. I&#39;m saying we are equal value no matter how much work either of us are doing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, that&#39;s your decision and that&#39;s your I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not my decision. This is the decision we made when we started it. That continues to be my decision. You&#39;re asking to change it. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t think we should change it. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.And that&#39;s your decision. I don&#39;t... I mean you agree to that. I don&#39;t agree to that. So that&#39;s where it is. And it&#39;s.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know we&#39;re in the same spot we were two hours ago when I said &quot;okay.&quot; I mean, I hear you, dude.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. So sorry. I mean, I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s there is nothing else to say, and I don&#39;t think that you&#39;ve heard...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There is... we have payroll coming up. I don&#39;t know how much money&#39;s in the bank account. I haven&#39;t looked at it yet. We got all sorts of things coming up.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s bills, there&#39;s all sorts of stuff.

And so I&#39;m aware of all of those things. They became a big part of the conversation.</p><p><strong>53,
-admits 53 closure was fraud and was told to distributors.</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I say this because when I say, what are you going to say to S&amp;S You say, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What what will I say to them? I will find a way to lie to them that we don&#39;t have money. That&#39;s all that I can say.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, no we could come up with something, talking to each other, saying that it was fraud, which it it&#39;s starting to turn out to be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It has nothing to do with the bank account. We can fully pay from the bank account.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it. But for... Okay. I was saying for sewing a story that buys us more time, you could say our account got held for fraud.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They know that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;ve said I&#39;ve had the same conversation for two weeks with them. They don&#39;t care what it is. They just need their money. That&#39;s what it is. So there&#39;s not really even I mean, the conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I just put money in. You said you were going to put money in too. Are you going to do that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I&#39;m asking you the question... I&#39;m asking you because things have changed, apparently. So Is that still something you&#39;re going to do?</p><p><strong>contradicts,
LG tells JZ to take money out of RBC account then files that JZ took the money for self enrichment at the cost of RBC</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I would I would prefer to have your money returned, but which is why I would like to see what the amount of money that has to be paid out so we can make a decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I would just say I don&#39;t need it, need it back.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But please, let me let me follow through.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If we want to just put it to the side when we get it back and keep it there, that is fine, is what I was going to say so we could keep it there as a cushion.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand. I would prefer to not do that, which is what I&#39;m trying just to get at with how much is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get that. But knowing how to transfer money in and out takes fucking days and I can&#39;t transfer out of there. I mean, I guess I technically can, but just don&#39;t... Just in keeping money there, put it in a savings. I mean, it being there doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, but I don&#39;t that&#39;s. Yes, that&#39;s an amount of money. Is that an amount of money that is necessary for us? No, we still need more. That has to come in, which is part of my continued path for today of figuring out everybody that&#39;s still owes us money, that is not bringing in money along with whatever I can continue to do to generate future sales.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But there&#39;s just same thing that I said with Happy Monkey is like at a certain point I cannot physically make them just have money appear and I cannot physically.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m not like blaming you for the amount of money coming in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Im not saying that you are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I want you to know I&#39;m not holding.... I understand these people pay when they pay. Now...okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I hear you... I hear you. I hear you and I love you. And we will figure it out, bro. Okay. I mean, that&#39;s that&#39;s all I could say right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I&#39;ve seen the future and it works out and we&#39;re both happy. I mean, short of saying that, I don&#39;t know what I could say. I talk to my lawyer on Friday, I could set something up if you&#39;d like to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What.. Whatever you... It goes both ways. If you feel that that&#39;s best on your end, well, that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you&#39;re pushing towards wanting more and it not being a partnership like that, a 50/50 anymore, then you want to change the way things are and I don&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And, and that is a unproductive conversation for not only both you and I to have,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How? Why?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...but also to other people, because it&#39;s not something that&#39;s negotiable.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. Exactly. You&#39;re... </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So it&#39;s a partnership, a 50/50.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And you&#39;re trying to change it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I understand that. I&#39;m I&#39;m. I have no choice but to accept your decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You have a choice to honor what is already in place that we&#39;ve already agreed upon.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Correct. Correct.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So if you would like to change the game, there is the chance that the other person won&#39;t be into it. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to hear you. It&#39;s just that is not what we either of us signed up for. So, I mean, if if I say I&#39;m leaving, if you don&#39;t give me another ten grand a month, which doesn&#39;t exist, it&#39;s not &quot;Well, you&#39;re unreasonable!&quot; It&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re unreasonable. I&#39;m saying I respect your decision. And I&#39;m. All I&#39;m saying is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You just said &quot;it&#39;s non-negotiable. You&#39;re saying it&#39;s non-negotiable.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, it is. You&#39;re not. You&#39;re not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s no. There&#39;s nothing to negotiate on. There&#39;s something in place you want to change. And you&#39;re asking if you&#39;d like me to change.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>lg-no lawyers</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Exactly. It&#39;s. That is a non-negotiable. Yes. It doesn&#39;t. There&#39;s no conversation, whether it&#39;s between you and I, whether it&#39;s between 14 lawyers and 14 lawyers, that will change that decision. And that&#39;s it is what it is. I&#39;m just saying...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Instead of wanting for us both to do better, you want a piece of mine? My my answer for us to both do better is we just make the business better and it funnels to us like on every savings. But if your answer is, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll just take it out of Joe&#39;s cut. That&#39;s counter to anything that I&#39;d like to be part of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s, it&#39;s, not. But that&#39;s also doesn&#39;t necessarily mean.... It doesn&#39;t.... It&#39;s.... I...get it. I respect your decision, and I have no choice to respect your decision. All I simply was saying in reaction to saying...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, you have no choice but to continue to honor the decision we both made when we started.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Creative wording pushes things in a different narrative.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean.. It doesn&#39;t... that&#39;s doesn&#39;t.... none of it really changes anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>no lawyers</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand the situation. It just is... That&#39;s the.... it&#39;s... it is what it is. So again, in my response to you saying, would you like you to talk to your lawyer to set up an appointment? My response was simply, that&#39;s fine if you would like to do that. I don&#39;t feel that that&#39;s a productive conversation because...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If we don&#39;t do that, then you say, &quot;Well, then we just leave this with I guess it&#39;s all up to me?&quot; So my only way I could make that not all by you is to say, okay, let me put this into motion with the lawyer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You. I mean, you realize that it&#39;s like there&#39;s no... I&#39;m wrong no matter what in this situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. But what... But what are you... What is your...?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just trying to be agreeable. And so it&#39;s not us just leaving with &quot;it&#39;s on you to figure it out, Lucas.&quot; It&#39;s.. I put into motion something. So I&#39;m not just being bogus.</p><p><strong>-LG admits reason for wanting to leave, before JZ confronts with misappropriation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The only part that is on me to figure out is, is what my decision for my life would be. Which that&#39;s same is, is you. That doesn&#39;t involve me having to go to an attorney and say, &quot;Hey, I would just like to move on from this business and I&#39;d like to take a job at X, Y, Z place.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, that&#39;s... that doesn&#39;t... I don&#39;t... think that&#39;s anybody&#39;s position to make. If my choice is to to resign, then that&#39;s my choice to do just as much as it is yours. I&#39;m just simply saying that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know I didn&#39;t bring this up. I didn&#39;t say I want to have a meeting to let you know sometime in the future what I might possibly do. I&#39;m just trying to hear you out, be supportive, be understanding, try to make things better in the interim.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s all you can do and that&#39;s fine. And I appreciate that and accept that. And it&#39;s still it&#39;s not me turning and saying, great, it&#39;s all on me to decide...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...but it&#39;s all on me to decide because it&#39;s my it&#39;s...it&#39;s my own decision to make within myself. If I feel that&#39;s the best for me to do, then fine.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>wow, real-lg</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If that&#39;s the best decision for me to do and enact in four years, then then we have that conversation then. So it&#39;s not me giving you the ultimatum of saying, Oh, here&#39;s the ticking time bomb. My intention... </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Its worse. You say you don&#39;t care and at some point it might bubble into something really bad that involves both of us paying money. So, I mean, for you to throw up a flare like this and then be upset when there is nothing moving forward, which you don&#39;t want to move forward.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>admits, dir-evid, </h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t say I don&#39;t want to move forward with anything I say it&#39;s my choice to make that decision.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. And that&#39;s where we&#39;re at, and I respect that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s it. I mean, that&#39;s where it lies. It&#39;s the same.

I don&#39;t. I mean, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what else to say to that. Or there is no marching productive x, y, z list of &quot;Okay, let&#39;s start doing this&quot;, because you&#39;ve heard me and I&#39;ve heard you and that&#39;s where we are. So I don&#39;t know unless you feel like there&#39;s anything more to share about that.
