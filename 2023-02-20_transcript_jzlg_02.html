I don&#39;t, I mean.... My next steps of where... and that&#39;s why I feel like having the conversation was having the conversation, because I feel like the next steps of this just has to be with our own individual people involved and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. Good. Yes. Tell me the dates and we&#39;ll figure it out. But I mean, I feel like I am trying to get to some action items or any of that stuff because... right now, the floor needs a lot of stuff from me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, but the action items are... and this is... there&#39;s never an opportune time to have the conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. Well, then here, let me... They&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m here.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>actually goes on another 2h 23m same outcome</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t need to go for another two hours.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All I think... all my intentions were is to have a conversation and say that I felt like it would be more respectful... for you again, whether you feel like I&#39;ve said the same thing a million times or here we are having the same conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s just how I&#39;m wrapping things up. This isn&#39;t I&#39;ve heard this a thousand times, it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But but you have.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But, but what I&#39;m saying is I&#39;ve heard you every time... and I feel like every time that I&#39;ve heard you, you feel it....</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I didn&#39;t do anything about it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You feel it didn&#39;t have the effect that you wanted. So if you are able to tell me what the effect is that you want, I&#39;ll be happy to... because I mean, we&#39;re talking I... Do you need me to...?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I&#39;m fine if you want to do the the lawyer stuff. I&#39;ll get... I&#39;ll talk to my lawyer if you want to do whatever the answer is Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you want to just keep working right now, I&#39;ll stay on the phone. I&#39;ll stay on here and start do a PowerPoint presentation with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean yes to all of those things.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Is the option even there for either of us to stop working? No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Is that its own prison in itself? Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But my next steps are.. yes... trying to continue with that. What I didn&#39;t want it to be is saying, okay, the next thing that you&#39;re hearing, we have these conversations and then you&#39;re receiving a legal letter without our conversation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. And if you do that, that&#39;s fine. I just... we still have other stuff we got to do. I mean, make that stuff happen and we&#39;ll just see where it goes. It is what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, I. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean. What..what are you... I respect what you&#39;re saying. Isn&#39;t that the ultimate outcome or the, you know, the outcome that would be wanted for a healthy business relationship?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I guess so. I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. And I just think it&#39;s unfortunate that it seems to be what the situation is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And it&#39;s really... it&#39;s different for me because I&#39;m in... I think maybe I&#39;m in a different position... situation than you are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I don&#39;t... besides the bringing up of this kind of stuff. I don&#39;t have... I mean, there literally is zero issues.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m here to work. I don&#39;t... We see each other once in a while.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, can&#39;t we just work? And move forward with everything you said? Yes?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, yes. All of those things have to happen, period.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I don&#39;t there&#39;s no way to have this conversation. I mean, even if I were to tell you now, what&#39;s the... what&#39;s the situation?</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>ultimatum
lg-plan, worm, lg-real</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s either I would like to leave or I would like you to leave. You think we&#39;re capable of having that conversation?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yes, 1,000%. You think I&#39;m going to argue to stay in...? No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />(sarcasticly)&quot;You&#39;re going to work with me, Lucas!&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I would never do that. Of course you tell me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Every time I had a conversation with you seven years ago where I said the same thing and said.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But we&#39;re right now, let&#39;s talk about right now we&#39;re different people. Why don&#39;t we talk about right now?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m saying don&#39;t worry about remember this time back then and this and remember that. There&#39;s now and I&#39;m right here, right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. It&#39;s the same thing that has regardless of time, I do not feel like the division of labor is equal. I do not feel that for quite some time...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Is that... do you say that the division of labor is like my fault?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anybody&#39;s fault. I think it&#39;s just been what it is then what it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, why don&#39;t we just fix the amount of work that goes to you? Isn&#39;t that the answer?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, because I don&#39;t think... It doesn&#39;t change. It doesn&#39;t change, because it wouldn&#39;t be that any of those... any of those... roles, any of those responsibilities, they would never change and they will never change. It doesn&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We are the owners. We could do whatever we want. You can say you could come up with some outrageous plan of the way sales works now, and that is how it works. If it works, it works. I mean, there&#39;s no one stopping anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re talking about division of labor. Do less labor. How do I make that module work? No one&#39;s stopping you. No one is kicking all the work over there and closing the door and saying, &quot;This is Lucas&#39;s&quot;?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So, I mean, this is like:

(JZ roleplaying a fictitious sarcastic scene where JZ and LG roles are reversed):
&quot;Lucas. I got too many emails. I can&#39;t do this anymore.&quot;

You could say &quot;I&#39;m not the one sending the emails!&quot;

But I&#39;m like:
&quot;It doesn&#39;t change the problem. I have too many emails.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s not an issue. The issue is you have too much work. And you feel like you could be doing other stuff. And I&#39;m not saying other stuff as in going out shopping and hanging out. I mean, other stuff to move the business on or personal.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, it&#39;s... this argument is with yourself. I mean, if there&#39;s too much work, then don&#39;t do it. And then we&#39;ll just figure out how to make that work because those pieces need to be done.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s why I mean, when you were here, I don&#39;t know if you notice, but the entire time I&#39;m trying to remove work from you permanently.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Literally, I&#39;ve made it for, like, the last couple of months trying to make this take all work off Lucas&#39;s table.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, I mean, and if you don&#39;t see that, it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of upsetting.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you have to acknowledge that I, I&#39;ve been trying, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And so then this... this conversation is not with me. This is with yourself. And I&#39;m not being rude. It really is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because everything you&#39;re saying is like... I&#39;m like, &quot;okay, but that&#39;s not anything that I&#39;m doing&quot;.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If anything, okay, let&#39;s let&#39;s fix that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How much....? What can I take off your plate? And I&#39;m... I&#39;ve already tried to do it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got the I already built a thing that I could just send out to the next customer that makes you permanently never even see a file, ever, and make it so you never have to answer an email about it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I even pitched to you yesterday... Friday about making orders that literally just have notes in the customer notes and someone else puts it together. I mean, so for you to say that the division of labor is not fair, it it&#39;s as fair as you let it be. I&#39;m trying to...

I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re... It&#39;s not like...  don&#39;t take it like:

(JZ mimics a stereotypical stern voice for demonstration):
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing over there!&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing, because if I could, I would say, why don&#39;t we consolidate this?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re doing this way too much.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Why don&#39;t you give this to me and we&#39;ll figure out how to get that done here, which is literally the only thing I try to ever do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I&#39;m able to have any conversation you want.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You tell me you want me to leave.. You can tell me you want me to leave, but I would write down on a piece of paper the reasons that you really think it is that you want me to leave. Because I think you&#39;d be surprised.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. I&#39;m, I&#39;m aware. And I think part of that is not only given the actual legal structure of this, that I cannot that that&#39;s not a conversation. I can&#39;t just say X, Y and Z has happened X, Y, and Z continues to happen. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because I know that&#39;s... that would be... you need, you know, stuff to back it up. Yes, that is true. And that is... I&#39;m sorry that if you can&#39;t find anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If you can&#39;t find anything, what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />To have a reason to have me not here. I mean... this is... I mean, this is interesting to me but, not very shocking.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think it should be shocking. And I don&#39;t and I&#39;m not trying to have it be shocking. And I don&#39;t think... that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying this is where the conversation gets to a point of you&#39;re not... either you&#39;re not aware of it or...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, I&#39;m listening. You said you&#39;re saying it&#39;s workload. And then what was my answer? It was, How do we make your workload better? Like I always ask you. So, I mean, how is that an argument with me?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Workload is one of many, many things. I mean, that&#39;s one aspect of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then let&#39;s talk about another one. I mean, there&#39;s nothing that I&#39;m fighting you on. So, I mean, if you have issues, I want to make them better for you, even if it&#39;s just in the transition. I mean, we still have stuff to do. And I want to work here..... I want to continue to keep working with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t care if you if you say, &quot;hey, you know what? You&#39;re right. Let&#39;s forget this whole conversation. It looks like we&#39;re doing some stuff.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t need a ten year, you know, commitment on anything. I just need to be able to continue doing what we&#39;ve always been doing. And if, you know...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, but that doesn&#39;t work for me and that can&#39;t work for me anymore. Okay? Beyond the fact of me physically dying. I can&#39;t..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay... The answer is yes. Am I saying no to anything? Okay. I mean, I said my part. Well, you say your part and your part is.... I don&#39;t.... honestly, I&#39;m not really following. There is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But my part becomes... here&#39;s the problems. Okay, cool. What is the solve? Me coming up with just what the solve is?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, well, well all of this is....
