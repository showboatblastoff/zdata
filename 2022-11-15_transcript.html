You said you&#39;re recording this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m not. But do you want to?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br /> I would. Yes, I would like to have it all recorded.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think, you know, if I&#39;m the admin on this. Components. Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>System Audio: </strong><br />Recording in progress.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Do you see that thing?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn&#39;t realize. I got it. Got it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Oh, okay. All right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you could start if you want.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I think my, my intention for this is, is really to have this be conversation and. I don&#39;t want to come at it charged. I want to try to leave as much. Extra emotion for me out of it. And I think the, just like as an opener of it to clarify that this whole situation, I think in just the feelings that I have, have been a bigger issue, maybe not. I don&#39;t want to throw it back and forth and say it&#39;s not an issue for you or it&#39;s not. But I just want to speak very candidly and just say that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just want to let you know, dude, don&#39;t... this is how a conversation works. You say what you want to say and I respond and it is what it is. And there is no emotion in this. This is fact based and we&#39;re looking for solutions.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I don&#39;t, I just, I&#39;m just saying, I don&#39;t feel like you need to give me any prerequisites. I understand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. And and I appreciate that. But I think for me, it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to separate because there is there&#39;s so many different levels of emotion and there&#39;s and I&#39;ve been trying for real for years to try to separate a lot of those different things. And I&#39;ve tried to figure out which of those are either overly emotional in the wrong side of it, overly emotional in the what if side of it. And so that&#39;s the only reason that I&#39;m saying that. I&#39;m just I just want to try to have it be conversational, but also from my point of view, have it be something that is just that you understand that this is obviously important to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />1,000%.1,000%.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I feel like my, either my downfall of either how I&#39;ve approached it in the past has either been wrong. Either it&#39;s just never been the right timing. It&#39;s not been the right format for whatever reasons. I just feel like I have not had a chance to be able to have these conversations or have this conversation.

Not at your fault. Maybe mainly my fault. And so I don&#39;t want to have it be just an overly charged here&#39;s all of my issues, all of these issues are you I just want it to be, here&#39;s just where it is and where my head is at, where I want to hear your side of it, where your head is at. Because at the end of the day, regardless, it is a two fold situation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And a lot of the time I can be as selfish as anybody else and thinking, okay, well, this is me. I need to figure out what&#39;s best for me.

And one, it doesn&#39;t work in our situation.

Two, it doesn&#39;t work because I don&#39;t think that any one of those decisions or any one of those thoughts is fair to either of us, because it has to do with both of us.

Either one of our downfall, either one of our... any move in any negative direction affects both sides of it. And I think what I was saying on the emotional side of it is.

It&#39;s not me just being callous and saying this is business, this is and this is all that it is, because anybody could make that decision and to make those moves and just say, well, fuck it, I don&#39;t care.

But when I say that we have history, we have great history. We have deep personal history that is great history. We have history that is bad history. We&#39;ve got all of the middle grounds of history. And I think that when I think of it emotionally, I&#39;ve never wanted to make a rash decision or move, not only because of the great history of what we for real have built from nothing. Beyond that, to tear down that whole story would be its own disservice. But also...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just saying, I&#39;m not trying to tear down anything. I&#39;m just trying to print some shirts. So if there&#39;s an issue that you have, I&#39;d love to hear it, but... and I&#39;m listening. I&#39;m sorry. I did not mean to. No, no, You stopped because you saw me nodding. And this is... I didn&#39;t mean... I derailed. Sorry, go ahead. I&#39;m listening.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I know. I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s trying to tear it down. I&#39;m just saying an example that there is the opportunity for either one of us to tear it down. There is an opportunity for anyone in the organization.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But why would we do that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Why would we do that? We wouldn&#39;t do that. I&#39;m just. I&#39;m just saying, hypothetically that that&#39;s just in. In the grand scheme of things I could tear it down or you could tear it down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Got it. I jumped in. I&#39;m sorry. I get, I get what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m not caught up on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I&#39;m just saying that when when I think about those things, it&#39;s not about the act of tearing it down. It&#39;s not about the act of burning it down, but it&#39;s the things that then become so heavy on my shoulders again that are not specifically different from probably what our on your shoulders. And maybe we just don&#39;t talk about it, or maybe it&#39;s just different. Maybe it&#39;s not on your shoulders and that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s not, that&#39;s not a fault. But for me to have... there&#39;s distinct things, I think. Yes. That are issues that can be potentially worked through or maybe they can&#39;t be worked through. But when I think of things at the end of the day, and I&#39;m telling you this not for the dramatic effect, I can&#39;t tell you how many days and how many nights it for real keeps me up to the point of last night. I will wake up. I was up from three till 430. Not only going over this conversation, but just thinking how how can I better the conversation so it&#39;s done in the correct way. How does it not fly off the handles? How is it that I don&#39;t leave something that I&#39;m doing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s no there&#39;s no reason for it to go off the handles. It goes off the handles at a very specific point. And there&#39;s no reason for it. But because it&#39;s... if we&#39;re looking for solutions, there&#39;s reality and accepting reality. So, I mean, I want to work through any issue you have with me. We&#39;ve been here a million times. It always stops at I say, &quot;Lucas, tell me what the issue is. I want to work towards making us happy. Because if I&#39;m doing something that upsets you, I&#39;m not doing it on purpose.&quot; And then when I ask you, you say there&#39;s history. And I go, &quot;Just one thing&quot;. I want, I want us to work together. I do not know why and this right here, this meeting we&#39;re having right now is, and everything that&#39;s happened up to this minute is what flashed before my eyes when I showed up at... in Texas, when they told me that I couldn&#39;t go in the room and I was like, &quot;uh oh, here we go. I&#39;m backing out because every word is going to get to Lucas. I&#39;m terrified of hearing about something I didn&#39;t do from Lucas.&quot;

So I walked out and you kept sending me more stuff, and I went back in, showed it to him. They said &quot;he&#39;s gotta call. Why is he sending you stuff when he won&#39;t call?&quot;

And I&#39;m like, He&#39;s on a plane and then I was just like, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m leaving.&quot;

I go outside, I order the cab or I mean, I get a hotel room on my own money because I knew.

I got my... I got a hotel room on my own money, no problem. And I told you, don&#39;t sweat it. And I get that you were just trying to help. And I get you didn&#39;t put anything... You didn&#39;t do it on purpose. I get it. But I saw it immediately. The world flashed before my eyes. And imagine if you and I were at that event. Together with everyone there and I... dude, when when I was getting in the in the Lyft and I saw that guy walking out who was being a jerk to me the whole time. I just got in and didn&#39;t even say a fucking word because I was like, &quot;Oh, nice try. I&#39;m going to be on Lucas Cam.&quot; It doesn&#39;t matter anyway, and boom, I go to my room and I get the text from you. You spoke directly to the guy who realized he fucked up. And I get it. I understand the whole thing. The problem, and this isn&#39;t about problems I have. I could if we stayed the same, right now, I&#39;m in heaven. Because I have no malice towards you. I understand more than you would ever understand. And I don&#39;t even call you out on the hypocrisy of a lot of things because I too don&#39;t want to be called out on other shit.

We both move forward meaning well. And that&#39;s fine. But when the conversation becomes... 

I&#39;m just trying to tell you something offends me and within one minute, you just say &quot;your existence offends me.&quot;

And I got to hang up because, yeah, that&#39;s a good opener. I could really see that it would really go anywhere besides just proving to you what you already think I am.

Which in the end, I&#39;m just here to work, dude, I don&#39;t... again, I love you, and I understand you, and I also understand that I don&#39;t understand, which is why I&#39;m like, it is what it is. But if there&#39;s anything else I could do to make things better, please let me know, because, it does offend me that when I try to ask you something, you explode, but then you type me a super long letter saying, &quot;I&#39;ve tried talking to you and I&#39;m going to try to call you again.&quot; It&#39;s, you&#39;re writing that letter to yourself and I accept that. I accept all of it, and I get it, but oh, boy.

I backed out with my hands up, and here I go. I got to my room. I didn&#39;t even take my coat off. I laid on the bed face down until fucking nine in the morning when I talk to you. And after I told you, dude, I am so depressed by this happening. You picked the phone up and say &quot;whatever, do whatever you got to do. I got to get to go work out.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I was like. I didn&#39;t say anything. And then you&#39;re like, &quot;It&#39;s the only time that I&#39;m not chasing a kid around.&quot; I was, like, loud and clear. Loud and clear. I will see you on Tuesday. I knew, any sort of conversation was impossible.

I mean, you want to give yourself a heart attack? I could just have someone. I could send a message to someone and say &quot;I bumped into Joe Zangrilli at the airport and he was yelling.&quot; It would it would lead to your world in shambles and me walking on eggshells for months.

And here&#39;s how I here&#39;s what I think. You know how you are now, right? Like, like you know what it&#39;s like being yourself. Now imagine being yourself in ten more years and being in my situation. And I&#39;m not saying change anything, but just remember that.

I mean, like I said, if you want me to wear a fucking pink tutu on every fucking day around Chicago, I will. I don&#39;t give a fuck. I just whatever it takes, man. I&#39;m here. But the main issue is, why are we talking right now?

Because, you got really mad when I asked you a very simple question. As a business partner, it looks bad. And if and if you did something with no malice. Then clear it up. I mean, please. Because I can&#39;t understand how you would go do an event without mentioning it to me, much less multiple events.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But wait, let&#39;s let&#39;s back up. I mean, there wasn&#39;t multiple events. There really was that that event.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But it was and Rowboat did that? Because there&#39;s no invoice.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. There&#39;s 1,000% an invoice.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Where? For Constellation?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s not Constellation. It&#39;s... I mean, it is Constellation. It&#39;s under two lane. There is. It&#39;s been there because it&#39;s been being the entire scope of what they&#39;re trying to do has been being built for since mid-October.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So when did you buy the machines? I mean, all of it just becomes bizarre and it lines up with. Things from in the past.

This is not the first time that you&#39;ve done something with Suzanne and profited off it without... and hid it from me. And this is... I&#39;m not trying to start a fight. I remember that big blowout fight we had where you said all sorts of outrageous things ranging from I&#39;m going to burn the the building (misspoke), the business to the ground. You&#39;re a you&#39;re a sissy. You&#39;re a girl. That&#39;s why you didn&#39;t realize how dumb you were when I had two other businesses under your nose.

And then I can&#39;t even ask a question without being brought into the principal&#39;s office.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What I think the way that the question was initially delivered, you knew that you already had a problem with it. And to back up what you&#39;re saying of what do you mean profited off of it? Why would I, if it was something that wouldn&#39;t have gone... all of it has been handled through Rowboat since day one. I wouldn&#39;t be posting shit on Rowboats... and tagging Rowboat.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So you guys... and... then clear it up. I&#39;m sorry, I asked you a question. You have to understand why I asked you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I somewhat understand why you asked me, but at the same time I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m second guessed for anything that would have.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just explained it. So are you denying that you and Suzanne made those things in China and sold a gang of them? And then she showboated in my face about you guys made like 30 something thousand. So did that happen or not happen?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not denying that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But so okay, so I&#39;m just saying with past history there&#39;s one so... got... and what really tipped me off was the Amazon account which you&#39;re allowed to do whatever. I would never ask you, you know if, if, if you thought that that was a good idea to put something on the card. It&#39;s your business too. I don&#39;t ask any questions, but when you put all these things together, it does raise some questions. And I can&#39;t ask the questions? And...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You can ask the question.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You&#39;re more than welcome to ask the questions. But I think the problem for me becomes. Having to justify every single thing that I have done, let alone with... the only reason that it&#39;s in question is because she&#39;s associated with Two Lane (Constellation).</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />1,000%.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But if there&#39;s clear transparency of that through every single...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There is none. I mean, you ended an event and didn&#39;t tell me. And then when I asked you about it...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But why... what... I guess my question is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s weird. We&#39;re business partners. I think it&#39;s so bizarre that you would go buy a machine and that&#39;s fine. You took it on your own. I just, my only issue was I just called to say, &quot;does it bother you that it offends me?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It bothers me that it offends you but also bothers me that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, then, good. You&#39;re a normal person. Then that&#39;s good. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a question.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea but it equally bothers me that I&#39;m second guessed. And the reasoning behind every other thing that like how many how many orders and deals and things go through that one. I&#39;m not telling you every single one because you&#39;re busy. We&#39;re busy and it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just told you it offended me. And that&#39;s fine. I get it. If the answer is &quot;sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to offend you&quot;, then I say, &quot;well, I&#39;m okay... well, I get it.&quot; I&#39;ll not be offended and really not be offended because it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t think that you should be offended. I think that I&#39;m happy to explain every step of the way the intent of one purchasing machines, which clearly were purchased by the company for the company for... the. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Two months ago and I just heard about it. But, okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right, but they&#39;ve been sitting because this is supposed... the whole thing has supposed to become they... they don&#39;t do this. So at the drop of a hat, which it all came together this last weekend, which is why I had to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you bought the machines on 09/20, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. Whenever the fuck they were. Yeah, but they, they literally have been sitting in the garage since 09/20. I didn&#39;t even open the machines until the day before.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. I just asked and that&#39;s how, you know, back and forth goes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine, but that&#39;s... so... whatever. That&#39;s its own thing. I&#39;m sorry that you are offended by it, but I think that that is its own...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, and since we&#39;re on since we&#39;re on the question... on the topic, I got to ask.

Do you and Suzanne ever profit without me on any jobs that we&#39;ve on any jobs?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Never.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You don&#39;t have a staffing thing that she books or anything like that? Nothing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Nope. She&#39;s not allowed to deal with staff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay and then I... now I apologize deeply, but that&#39;s how it looked. And all I had to do was ask. And I&#39;m... I feel horrible. And, but that&#39;s the way it, it works. A real back and forth.

It&#39;s a dialogue between two people. And and I&#39;m sorry. And I am sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think my problem and my question is and this is part of other things that I... and issues that I have of, I don&#39;t understand why, and again, maybe it&#39;s my own whatever it is, I feel like I&#39;m so imprisoned to only being able to do what exactly that we do. I feel the... so much anxiety...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You mean like by business? By business-wise? Business-wise you feel? Is that what you mean? I&#39;m trying to understand what you&#39;re saying. You said you feel chained.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I feel. I feel There is such a level of anxiety of if I were to even run in next to my next door neighbor and tells me, Hey, what do we start? What if we start this business? And if I go to even explore that opportunity or even bring that conversation up to you?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, that&#39;s completely different in that it&#39;s not, &quot;Hey, me and my wife got these jobs going on and and, you know, we&#39;re shuffling this here and there.&quot; Those are two very different things because those are jobs that I&#39;m part of technically. Now, if you go and start a pizza business, how am I supposed to be any part of that? Like, I mean, it&#39;s the logical stuff that I&#39;m logically tied to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that. So if she were to have staffing agency then?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just... I just threw that out there as in, don&#39;t try to get me on a technicality in my wording. You know what I&#39;m saying? Is there anything that I don&#39;t know about? And that was my question. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And theres not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I just threw that out there, staffing as just an example.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that. I mean, I it&#39;s all hypothetical, but I think that my my issues with that are just I get the sensitivity to it. I think I immediately take offense to it because I feel like there are so many things that not only that I do that aren&#39;t for the applause that go on that you don&#39;t have any knowledge of, not because I&#39;m hiding it from you, but because it doesn&#39;t really matter if we&#39;re just the same shit is like there&#39;s so many things that probably I have no no idea that go on through the day and that you don&#39;t tell me about that. That&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then when I say something, tell me that. And like if... sorry just keep going.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s where the offense to me comes in, is that... there&#39;s not to play devil&#39;s advocate and say that I 100%...

I could be doing events every single night if I wanted to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t... that&#39;s... let alone... yes, that would be something that probably should be discussed, but at the same time...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which is why I just said it offended me and that&#39;s why I just wanted to say, does it matter to you that it offends me? That&#39;s all it was. And that&#39;s all I that&#39;s all I asked. And look what I mean. We could have a normal conversation, but you&#39;re only talking like this because it&#39;s being recorded.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean?

I mean, this is literally okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, why did we why did I disconnect the phone call?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Because I insulted you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Exactly. I mean, immediately. I mean, like, if you say let&#39;s talk on the phone and I pick it up and you just insult me immediately. Like, almost like, comically. I get it. I just think &quot;Oh, he&#39;s... he&#39;s really fucking jammed up&quot;, which I thousand percent get.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I could already see where it was going to. I mean I don&#39;t think it was even...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s the thing, it all is your... it&#39;s always all in your head. It&#39;s all &quot;I saw it going this way.&quot; I know what you did at the at the hotel.&quot; &quot;I saw where this was going.&quot; &quot;You know how you are.&quot; And then it&#39;s. I just have to go home and just let the the dominoes fall where they are because it&#39;s he&#39;s got a movie in his head of what really happened and forgets every single time that every time something like this happens, it turns out to be an overreaction and someone recants or it turned out to never be real in the first place. But where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire. But I can&#39;t stop that because we are busy and we have customers and there&#39;s interactions.

Now, have I ever done anything, literally anything that could have harmed Rowboat? Like, for real that turned out that I, for real, did something that could have hurt... hurt Rowboat.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh. I don&#39;t know. I mean, there was quite a few interesting episodes during Covid.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And they all turned out to be? Incorrect.

The guy who said I broke into his spot and was yelling and telling the guy I was going to kill him or whatever the fuck it was then turned around later and told Mike that he just made it up?

Or the person who blamed the party on me over there when I clearly didn&#39;t do it. But that one you knew I didn&#39;t do. But there was like 3 or 4 of them and every single one of them turned out to be incorrect what you were mad about. So it&#39;s like you want it to be. It turns out to not be. There&#39;s always ridiculous amounts of evidence that prove the opposite. But you just know there&#39;s always smoke. There&#39;s always fire. He&#39;s going to burn it down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But my, my concern...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I mean, like so and when you said when you said over Covid, name one. Just one thing. One thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, you&#39;ve got multiple fights with people outside. You were in a car wreck outside. I mean, there was there were things that were completely separate to to. Whatever it was in your normal life, however you live in your normal life, that&#39;s fine. But it doesn&#39;t matter to see those things and say, okay, well great, that was a potential disaster to the company. Any this day and age, anything outside of the norm is a potential disaster.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I understand. And it all comes to trust. It&#39;s either think I&#39;m a total moron who is so out of control he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing or I&#39;m smart enough to be your business partner and still be here after 16 years or how many ever years it is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s not but that&#39;s not what&#39;s in question. And it doesn&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, you can&#39;t apologize for being wrong about about the the the hotel thing. You can&#39;t apologize about... I clearly told you how devastated I was by it. It was just &quot;whatever.&quot; 

Got it loud and clear. Now I&#39;m just tired of it. I don&#39;t know why you are so involved with me. You don&#39;t even know me. I purposely do not tell you anything, because the second I tell you something, you use it against me.

I told you about Amy, and everything turned into &quot;You know how stressed you are, dude. Oh, I&#39;ve been hearing this and I&#39;ve been hearing this. You know.&quot;

I was like &quot;I just had to tell him.&quot; I just had to tell them. And you even used it against me, like, insulting me, right...right in the middle of me telling you about something about me and Amy.

You&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, don&#39;t talk to me like I&#39;m Amy.&quot;

And I was like... I have to hide everything from you because you try to make it a new thing to be upset about. And if you... That&#39;s how I feel.

And, and that&#39;s fine. Just let me print my goddamn shirts, please. I&#39;m not even telling you to stop. I get it, but, it is what it is. So what can what can I do? And I&#39;m not being ridiculous or silly. For real?

What can I do to make this better? What is an actual issue? What is one concrete thing that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think the what actually can be done is figuring out what my potential exit looks like. I think what your potential exit looks like. I think what every single one of those next steps of any part of that, because those are not things that... I can&#39;t make those decisions for myself or for us.

The way that things are structured, it has to be an agreed upon thing. It has to be we&#39;re either somewhat on the same page of what any part of that looks like. There&#39;s so much process in every single one of those different directions.</p><p><strong>LG has booked under his name at least 10 to 15 times each time having same issue where LG has to be contacted to approve JZ entering. Has led to JZ sleeping in lobbies while waiting for LG to answer calls.
</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And you want to go through with that while we&#39;re doing great and nothing&#39;s wrong, for real nothing&#39;s wrong. You... I got screwed up at a fucking hotel thing. Like I have about 10 or 15 times and every time I still let you do it and I don&#39;t say anything because I get it.

And this time I just walk away and leave. And I still I&#39;m getting the &quot;we got to check out our our exits.&quot;

In the end. How about this? You start whatever paperwork you want. I&#39;m all aboard. But in the in the meantime. I&#39;m still here, man. And I still love you. And I still want to keep doing this. I don&#39;t... there are things that we should do. You know, like legally and law... like filing this, that and the other thing. And I&#39;m all for whatever, you know. There is no &quot;no&quot; coming from me. But there&#39;s also... Uh, I don&#39;t understand this struggle. I&#39;m the one with the questions for you about the PlayStation and all these other things. And when I ask you about it, you go, &quot;What do you mean? Explain yourself.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well I genuinely didn&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The funny thing is that I genuinely didn&#39;t know about that. And so just to clarify what that is, because then as I looked into it after that, so when the PlayStation was purchased as a gift through Amazon, you have to do it through it&#39;s through an invitation service. So I applied for an invitation months and months ago that... our Amazon, that is not only the business thing is linked there&#39;s about 14 different...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you used our you used you used the Rowboat card on it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t... when the invitation was accepted, it just defaults to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s fine and that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t go into some rage about this because there&#39;s probably an explanation. But then...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But the funny thing is in the end...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then I saw a bunch of I mean, it goes all the way back. There&#39;s a lot.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is. There&#39;s there&#39;s tons. If you see everything and if you see every single thing of what it&#39;s actually charged to and there&#39;s been multiple if you go in our bank feed to that I&#39;ve had to had Amazon completely refund and recharge. The other thing because there&#39;s three different personal cards that we have, there&#39;s four different business ones. I&#39;ve had this conversation for real with Amazon multiple times.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I apologize for bringing it up.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t... it&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s why this is... normal conversations work great.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I agree. I just it&#39;s I&#39;m not laughing at you or the situation. I&#39;m laughing at the situation because I honestly had no idea about that until then. The fact that I looked into it and then it arrived. So that was its own blessing for it. And I put it on the draws line item and said this was not supposed to be towards this and that&#39;s fine. But there is... Amazon is its own fucking chaos of nonsense.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">You don&#39;t have to explain that to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Again. No, I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I accept your answer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />In the midst of everything, whether it&#39;s just genuine question, whether it&#39;s also just confusion or thinking that there&#39;s bigger things going on than they&#39;re not, then I, of course want to justify that because I wouldn&#39;t... neither of us would be that dumb to be doing that. I don&#39;t know where... I would never assume that &quot;okay, well, he&#39;s not going to smell this or see what this is.&quot;

That&#39;s fine. It&#39;s also not a Lamborghini that is out there. And I have no problem saying, &quot;Cool, that was completely fucked up&quot; as they fucked up 14 million other things that I had to have them reverse and put the charge back through and something else. So, I found humor in that situation itself because I honestly had no idea what you were talking about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But yeah I mean, I&#39;m just saying I saw all these things at the same time and anyone would come to the same exact conclusion. So and here I am, I&#39;m apologizing. And that&#39;s why I just asked you. And that&#39;s why a normal answer would have not given you this anxiety.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that. But I think the anxiety comes from just the overall sphere of anxiety. And to to your question of why are we here? And it has nothing to do with the the Texas situation.

(unheard)</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s how I. That&#39;s how I operate. Terrified of derailing anything, but it never helps.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But the derailment wasn&#39;t there. And I&#39;m telling you this wholeheartedly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There was never a moment when I&#39;m walking around town by myself stewing, saying, &quot;This fucking idiot, this guy, this guy, fuck this guy.&quot;

The biggest thing and the absolute biggest letdown to me was that after all of these years that as I was sitting there, all I was thinking, that is. It&#39;s just a bummer what the relationship has become. It&#39;s a relationship what we have built has become to its current status. Yes, there&#39;s been some great successes. There&#39;s been some great wins. But if it&#39;s me and if it&#39;s all me, then that&#39;s 100% that I can&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was reaching out to you for help. I was telling you my feelings like I always do. And I got the same disrespectful results like I commonly do. And I just knew it. I saw where it was going. It was going to multiple very long texts calling me a loose cannon. That&#39;s... I mean, you&#39;re allowed to think that but one thing that I don&#39;t tell you is I don&#39;t leave the house. I stay here either with the kids or by myself. Only time I go out is when I go to an event. And only time I get upset is when I get screwed over. But I just left. And that makes no difference. Because the end result was predestined.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But it does make a difference because.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m saying I&#39;m saying the second something happens, I could evaporate... and have... because the end result has nothing to do with me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Whatever you&#39;re mad about didn&#39;t happen. And I tried telling you, but you were so mad.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not mad. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m, I literally at no point did I, and this is just as much as you said... I at no point was did I even say anything about jumping to conclusions. The only thing that I and I didn&#39;t say that I&#39;m on this guy&#39;s side. I even talk to this guy. I didn&#39;t even talk to any of them all. I literally that was just the the text conversation from them and that was it. And to me, it was it didn&#39;t matter to me because it was it was what it was going to be.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, but it was one more thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It was one more thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, I know. One more thing that was actually nothing, like 90% of them, but doesn&#39;t matter. Lucas&#39;s book is permanent. But in the end I&#39;m not here defending myself or anything. I&#39;m just saying I&#39;m willing to work like this. It&#39;s not easy. But I&#39;m willing to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I get that, but I&#39;m not willing to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it. So fill out whatever paperwork and I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll sign on to it and be on board. Until then, I&#39;m... Let&#39;s keep working.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t... It&#39;s not that easy. It&#39;s just not that easy.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. So then what are we talking about? I mean, we both understand. So how do we start that, is the question, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know. I the only process that I know from that and this is not to dig up the old stuff, but when I brought it up to you last time and said, look, we&#39;ve got to find somebody regardless, we could be smiles and rainbows. There has to be some sort of...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />When did I say no? I never said no. So I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re saying it to me like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I distinctly remember where I was standing when you said no. You said &quot;no, where did this person come from? It&#39;s someone you found, I&#39;m not using them.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yes. So that&#39;s not &quot;No&quot;, that&#39;s &quot;here&#39;s this one person,&quot; and it didn&#39;t pass the smell test. So I said, I don&#39;t I&#39;m not comfortable with using that person. And then it just stopped because we were getting along. And and I&#39;d like to... if... what was that time we were arguing about? What didn&#39;t I do that time?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It wasn&#39;t an argument. That actually was a very neutral argument. We were just saying, Hey, we need to get an operating agreement in place because it was right when you were either starting or you were already in motion with the divorce. And the point of the conversation was we have... no one knows on either side of what happens. There wasn&#39;t even in a smiles and rainbows conversation of saying, for real and I&#39;ve tried to ask you this of like, what do you what do you want? Like if everything is completely fine, do you want to be here in five years? Do you want to be here in ten years?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Again, I said no, and it&#39;s the same as you. So what have we got to do? That&#39;s the question. I don&#39;t know why this is a presentation.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s a presentation because there&#39;s not... because it&#39;s never been this conversation. And I think the things to do and I stopped that process because I took it on and I was more offended of I&#39;ve gone through this, I&#39;ve found as what I felt was a completely neutral person, talking to them, having the conversations, taking time.... I had conversations with them through a weekend, came back and brought it to you and thought, okay, this is something that could be good. Why is that funny?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because the time involved is such a big deal to you. We both spend so much time in everything. I mean, &quot;I went out of my way and found this.&quot; That doesn&#39;t mean &quot;no&quot;. We clearly were in some sort of a tiff. And I was I specifically remember saying the second anything goes down on paper, the dynamic changes.

I do remember that and I didn&#39;t come up with that out of nowhere. So I am still open for that. I never said no. Just because there&#39;s been so many things that I found you to be untrustworthy about, &quot;I didn&#39;t trust that person.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. I mean, I only stop that because then why am I going to take more energy to find these people? So..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. We can come up with a number and say you find X amount, I find X amount however we come together with those people.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What do you mean? What amount? What do you talking... I&#39;m not following.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Find three people. Find three corporate people that you feel you like. Then we both. That&#39;s the only way that I know how to make something that is mutually agreed upon person which I don&#39;t fucking care about. It doesn&#39;t matter to me. It just has to be somebody that has been through this and has the seasoned experience to say, Here&#39;s... here&#39;s how we do it. That&#39;s 1,000% what step one is. That&#39;s step one through good days. That&#39;s step one through bad days because I have no concept...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I have, the answer is yes. The answer is yes. Still yes. I&#39;m just saying we can move on to the next thing, so.</p><p><strong>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RhqrSM3yeTDg-Oy3fyD6G4DZ0eRxRy0d&usp=drive_fs</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And beyond that, I don&#39;t know the... the world of what this has become. It has nothing to do with me just saying great, all of these things, my hard book of evidence and everything else that I don&#39;t want to have to deal with anymore. I can&#39;t tell you what that is. All I can tell you is that I don&#39;t have anybody else or any sort of relationship like this in my world at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know because there&#39;s... there&#39;s no one else that you&#39;re allowed to be completely alone with and say all sorts of outrageous things and no one else hears it. And you&#39;re not... there&#39;s no one else that you have access to do that to. So and I put up with it. That is why you can&#39;t. And I&#39;m not your psychiatrist, but it&#39;s very clear. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s almost comical to the point of:

(JZ roleplaying as LG and JZ)
JZ as LG: &quot;there&#39;s no talking to you.&quot;
JZ as JZ: &quot;Okay, hi.&quot;
JZ as LG: &quot;Ahhhh insult!&quot;
JS as JZ: &quot;Oh. I just...&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I would say the same exact thing to you then.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And then I&#39;m here. I&#39;m always here to listen, and I&#39;m always here to give a rational response that is not &quot;fuck you.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re a little girl&quot; or &quot;I despise your existence&quot;, all things that you have said and like I said in that text, shit.

It&#39;s super lame that I have to when I see you pretend that you don&#39;t say that shit. And you&#39;re not going to say anything about it now, why would you start now? Because that&#39;s acknowledging.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just... I don&#39;t... that&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t agree with that and your gonna tell me that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What is there... what is there to not agree with?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t agree with that... I do not feel... and I&#39;ve said that for years and I will forever say that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So those those responses that I got from you, during me trying to ask you business stuff. You didn&#39;t say that stuff?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I absolutely said it. I have no problem, I&#39;m not, I&#39;ve never, I&#39;m not denying those... those... all I&#39;m simply saying is that you feel that there is no situation where I can interact with somebody the way that I speak to you or interact with you. And I would say the same exact thing back to you, that there is nobody else that interacts with me the same way. And it doesn&#39;t matter, because on either side...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What am I doing right now? I mean, what is the interaction that we&#39;re talking about? Like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean? Like all of...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, this is a confrontation. We&#39;re talking about stuff. Usually it&#39;s just you and I talking about what color this or that is supposed to be or a front location or where I got to go. So these confrontations are remembered because it&#39;s, you know, two heads in a box talking to each other, usually over the same thing, and usually me saying &quot;that&#39;s not what happened.&quot; and... and then I hear about your mental anguish, which I get, but none of this is necessary.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And at the end of the day for me... it doesn&#39;t... it&#39;s not a &quot;you&quot;, it&#39;s not a &quot;me&quot;, it&#39;s both of us. And it&#39;s just extremely toxic. And it&#39;s just something that I cannot do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, then if we both say these are our issues with each other and the other person keeps going past those boundaries, that is where the issue is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So that&#39;s fine then I&#39;ll take that on as fault. I&#39;m just saying that I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So don&#39;t. But don&#39;t say that. It&#39;s just so toxic. It&#39;s. It&#39;s so toxic out of nowhere? I just...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think it... I don&#39;t think it matters. I think its one person...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It could very easily... I&#39;m just saying, if we... It could very easily not be toxic if we just continue working and make it normal.

Stop. Stop sticking our noses into other people&#39;s business and assuming stuff.

I don&#39;t ask you one simple question. I don&#39;t ask you anything.

I get all sorts of people telling me crazy shit that we&#39;ve done business with, and I assume:
&quot;well, there had to be a reason he did that&quot;
or
&quot;there had to be a reason he did that.&quot;
&quot;Oh, wow. You probably fucked up. He fucking talked to you like that?&quot;

I don&#39;t just walk... I don&#39;t say &quot;he&#39;s a fucking hothead.&quot; I say, &quot;Wow. The person who complained probably was a dick and deserved what the fuck they got.&quot;

That&#39;s how partnership works. I trust what you do, but when I don&#39;t, I have to ask you. So if you want it to not be toxic, let&#39;s just keep working and stay out of each other&#39;s business, because I have every single reason to keep doing what I&#39;m doing. The same way you do. I don&#39;t know why... I talk to you more than anyone I&#39;ve ever talked to, married, girlfriend, anything.

And it&#39;s all about me. It&#39;s all some shit that needs to change with me. But that&#39;s fine. What... what is... do you want me to not go to a hotel? I won&#39;t go to a hotel anymore. I mean, I don&#39;t understand. What, like these? You think like a gate around me is going to do anything. You don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on here. So you want it to not be toxic? Let&#39;s just stay out of each other&#39;s business. And...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s, that&#39;s fine. And that&#39;s one solution, but it doesn&#39;t... at end of the day, it has... you could take yourself out of it. I&#39;m just saying, I don&#39;t know, one, that this is something I want to do anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t either. And again, I&#39;m saying yes to what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m just saying if you want to, on top of all of that, get rid of the toxic and all this other whatever. Then... lets, we got to cooperate.

And it&#39;s called a back and forth conversation. One person says something, the other person answers. And it&#39;s because we care about each other&#39;s feelings and not because we&#39;ve got a lot of shit to do. Or &quot;I just need to get this off my plate&quot;.

It&#39;s because we respect each other and if we can&#39;t respect each other, there is no moving forward, no matter what, and probably no moving forward in life at all, because it&#39;s the same situation over and over and over. 

Now, I don&#39;t want to be here the same as you don&#39;t. So I mean, I don&#39;t even give a fuck if you send me the if that same last person that I said no to. You already put the time in. I&#39;m not fucking with you. But I don&#39;t care. Let&#39;s call.

Next step, figure out business valuation whether it&#39;s fucking for all we know, they might say it&#39;s worth fucking nothing. You better keep it. Who knows? Let&#39;s figure it out. I&#39;m working as hard as I can to get the books ready and everything for us. We&#39;re sitting on the same side of the table right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />We are sitting on the same side of the table. But I just I... I don&#39;t know. I feel like it&#39;s not the same side of the table and I feel like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I definitely do not... I agree with you. It is very skewed. But I accept it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But what is skewed? And if that&#39;s something that is being skewed on my side, then how am I supposed to be getting better at what that is? Because I have my set of skews?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s what I just said. We try... I asked you a question, the answer is just ridiculous. And I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just asking you to have a normal conversation with me when I request a normal conversation. And I never intend to... I don&#39;t want to be yelling. I don&#39;t yell. When was the last time you and I yelled at each other? I don&#39;t yell. I don&#39;t even get mad, dude. I just... I&#39;ve learned... I&#39;m fucking 47 years old. Fucking 47, bro. I just walk away. I mean, I&#39;d have to produce a documentary to prove it to you, but... let&#39;s keep moving on. But know that whatever you think, you got the boogeyman in your head. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the boogeyman. I think it&#39;s very justified feelings, and I think it&#39;s just justified reality. And it&#39;s not anything that, as I said in the beginning, that is a personal attack by any means. But I think that. I don&#39;t know what else can be done.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s move forward and do what we were just talking about. And we could do it as friends and continue working until, you know, the five years or whatever the fuck it is, is up and you&#39;re still my best fucking friend that we that we don&#39;t even talk, but it still is the same. I&#39;m with you, man. I&#39;m with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think I just need to have you be on the other side. Helping make those decisions, but also.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But what do you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Putting in? What?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, you mean like the. Yeah, dude. I mean, we always split all the work up. Tell me what I need to do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. Well, I think this is the prominent work of like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The what work?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t want to just ask that question and say &quot;What do you want to do in five? What do you want to do period? And that&#39;s not a rhetorical question.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was just hoping on having the business propped up and living a little easier and not be thinking about it. The same as you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But also, like beyond that, I mean, I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the reality of saying I don&#39;t I don&#39;t need an answer now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know what I want to do. I just buy buildings and fix them up and shit. Fun shit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />When what? When does like, when does that start? And again, this is not I don&#39;t know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m in no rush. This is the first time in my... dude my divorce still, still one more meeting. They realized they could get more money. So now it&#39;s the December 28th even though all the paperwork is filled out and returned and certificates given. But there&#39;s something more on the 28th and I&#39;m just sitting here playing guitar and loving it. And I want the same for you. Like, whatever that is. We&#39;ve worked our fucking asses off and that&#39;s what we deserve.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />We do. But I think I also like that is not... It&#39;s just not my reality. And I don&#39;t... and maybe part of that building resentment and stress and anxiety is the fact that I know that that&#39;s... I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t do that and I can&#39;t do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, that&#39;s why that&#39;s why you could do whatever you want after that time. I mean, let&#39;s figure it out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m talking now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, I know, but there&#39;s reality. We can&#39;t snap our fingers and make that disappear and not have bills anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not saying that. I&#39;m just saying that what is what I feel is on my shoulders is unweighted for what I, what I can just stomach and what I can even do anymore. I cannot, I cannot just continually work from 6 am to 10pm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No one&#39;s asking you to. It&#39;s very simple. I mean, put together. I mean, we&#39;ve talked about it. We&#39;ve said get a person. But then your answer is then it slows me down. So which one is it? I mean,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s not what this is supposed to be about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m continually building systems to make everything easier, specifically for you. And it&#39;s necessary. And we... get a person, I mean... Now, I told... I&#39;m not saying I told you, but I&#39;m saying it&#39;s outrageous to think you can handle all that work. And it&#39;s, it&#39;s pretty crazy. I can&#39;t. I mean, I tell you all the time, I can&#39;t believe how do you do it? So. And I have no part of that. Get ten people. I don&#39;t care. And I&#39;m dead serious. I don&#39;t look at those numbers mean fucking nothing to me. If we&#39;re fucking losing... in the end, they&#39;re looking, Hey, this year. Did you look at that shit? It looked fucking good. But we might have to throw a couple of other people in there and it might slow things down a little, but it&#39;s just all figuring out protocol and how to fucking make it when flipping things in the fucking Printavo.

I don&#39;t want you to fucking have to handle all that, bro. Yeah and trust me, I get it. I 1,000% understand where you are, because in the end, each little thing you have to do is it&#39;s just one more little thing. Then I just got to do this. Then I got to do that and it never fucking stops. And it always... you always have the best, you know, best intentions. But then you&#39;re buried. And then one thing happens and now you&#39;re fucking... there&#39;s a fucking dam waiting to fall. A whole world falls on top of you. And the only way you&#39;re the only one who can fix it because you buried yourself. And you&#39;re the only one who knows all the stuff in your head. Dude, I lived there. It&#39;s fucking madness.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just think the reality, though, is that if that&#39;s the case, then everything starts to slide backwards, which is fine. But I want to be very clear that that&#39;s what the impact of that is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And right now you are fucking so far outperforming anything I ever expected. So if you want to dial it back, dial it back. I take no offense. There&#39;s reality. And whatever, man. If we have to have more people spend more money to make the fucking same, I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s all fucking fake. And the fucking... it&#39;s all part of the purchase. It&#39;s all added into the shirt. I don&#39;t care. Bro, I&#39;m telling you. I am here for you. And there&#39;s a way that you and I could be very happy, if we just put our fucking really smart heads together.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just feel very trapped.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t want that for you. And I fucking get it, man. I don&#39;t want that for you. But and let&#39;s prepare. Who knows? I mean, this shit... I could drop dead and have a fucking heart attack. This shit has to be done. But during all that, let&#39;s try to lighten our loads on ourselves, man. I want you to know you can trust me, bro, but I get it. But know that I will always have our best interests in mind no matter what. And there&#39;s always...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think that you don&#39;t and I don&#39;t think that you ever hadn&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I know, I know. But that you ever had and I don&#39;t. And I don&#39;t think you think the opposite. I say that in, in response to you saying that you feel trapped.

In the end I know you and I will always figure things out and let&#39;s just keep working towards the ideal. And the ideal is just the books are clean. You know what I mean? So... so someone could fucking see our valuability and or we could see our own availability and say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s, uh. If we say, you know, with this many heads, we could roughly make this much and we put someone in charge of fucking making sure x, y, z, you know, KPIs are being hit, the doors stay open and you and I are fucking... don&#39;t have to even remember that that shit exists. And there&#39;s a way to do it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is. I just want to feel the the confidence that you&#39;re there with me to that same.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Bro, I fucking am. I&#39;ll come sit on your lap right now. I am, man.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I also, I also, I want to exist in a world where I don&#39;t feel that. I don&#39;t want you to feel like any other moves. Any other explorations? Any other. Anything. Even just blue... I can&#39;t tell you how fucking scarred I am from that conversation. Literally the blue sky conversation of just throwing out the concept of a pizza place.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are you talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That conversation really was one of the very last that was just like, I just I can&#39;t even like... we can&#39;t talk.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What are you talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I can&#39;t tell him?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m trying to remember what you&#39;re talking about.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />When it was like one of the first couple months, like we had just moved into the house and we were talking about that and I just blue skied the fact that there is no good Chicago pizza in North Carolina. And I didn&#39;t even fault you and I&#39;m not... There was so much going on. I get it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What did I say?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You were so charged and so many... You you immediately, I think, took it as a threat of some sort that now with all my extra off time which has never existed, that that&#39;s what I was going to go be going and doing and starting a pizza company now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I apologize and I know at the time you&#39;re talking about and I do I was probably doing what you do a lot where we just get mad at each other because it&#39;s easier to concentrate on that. And I and I apologize. And I apologize and and I&#39;ll tell you it. I don&#39;t know what it was, but I would assume it was a I felt buried in the shop alone and It was just easier to be worried about you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />1,000%.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I apologize.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I and I appreciate that. And I accept that. And I and as much as I accept that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I do, I do remember I. I had a lot going on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, you for sure did. And I. And I remember literally putting down the phone and just thinking that again, it&#39;s not my situations are never like, here&#39;s me throwing the phone and saying, fuck this guy. It&#39;s for fucking real to a fault in my heart that it always is. What happened to the conversations when it was literally all of this aside and it was me just saying, hey, beyond this Liftpoint that I&#39;m looking to start a different project, I&#39;m going to do jazz, and you would have been so receptive to that of just saying, Fuck yeah, do that. Start 14 different projects. It was never something that was.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />When it was tied, then it became tied to my workload and, and then it becomes resentful.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But, but, and I see that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And it&#39;s not an excuse. I&#39;m just saying that&#39;s what happened to me. It&#39;s not an excuse. I&#39;m saying that that&#39;s what happened.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But and you&#39;re 100% justified in thinking that way, but I&#39;m telling you, there hasn&#39;t been one thing and I haven&#39;t. I wish I had 14 different businesses to tell you, Hey, look at what has been here. And then I&#39;ve still been doing 500% my effort through all of these.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I understand a lot more. After working through the computer with you after so long and realizing it&#39;s not standing and staring at the clock that is what makes us money. We both work on different schedules.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Standing and staring at three screens.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Trust me, dude, I get it. I understand different and I apologize for anything before.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, and I&#39;m just I just want to bring that up because and I&#39;m telling you now, there&#39;s not some other big and that&#39;s.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How and that&#39;s how we get rid of resentment is you bring it up and I reassure you sincerely.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m just, I&#39;m, I&#39;m just scared of death of those conversations. If I literally told you that, hey, you know what I really want to do? I would love to go back to school.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I would love that for you as long as we&#39;re able to set... I mean, we just need to set something up so it is possible. How do I help you do that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />100%. That&#39;s all not even reality. I&#39;m just, I&#39;m just saying that if there are those things, I don&#39;t, part of that anxiety, part of that feeling like I don&#39;t want to even talk about those things I don&#39;t want to talk about...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But we can.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Even donating my time. If I were to say, Hey, I want to volunteer for this company, if I want to do business coaching for this company, because that&#39;s just something that&#39;s in my heart,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I would never I don&#39;t have any problem with any of that stuff. Now, if it was, you start a business that somehow keeps making its way into our business, that&#39;s where I would feel slighted because we&#39;re still doing the same work. It&#39;s just let&#39;s cut this guy out through this cleve.., which I apologize for thinking that, but I&#39;m just saying. I understand. And please don&#39;t let Joe from the past, ruin your thoughts of the future.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m telling you, bro, getting away from Amy, and the constant whatever that was. And I don&#39;t even talk to my parents anymore. My parents still don&#39;t even know I&#39;m divorced. I&#39;m the happiest guy in the universe. I sit around and read books, bro. I sit and fucking play guitar and bass until I realized that I fell asleep with my contacts on and I fucking love every minute of it. And of course I realize what an idiot I fucking been. And it&#39;s even fucking worse when it just gets rubbed in my fucking face, not by you, but just by the by the world with the fucking ridiculous amount of shit that, &quot;I understand why he thinks that&quot;. &quot;Well, of course, all these pieces of the puzzle will fall in just like that.&quot; Of course, but I deserve it, and I fucking get it. But, and this... talking like this is how we get rid of our anxiety. It&#39;s seeing how, who that person really is. I think I haven&#39;t been talking to you for, like, 20 years. I&#39;ve been working with you. And I&#39;m not that person anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t think that you are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I know, and I know you&#39;re not, and I know you&#39;re not either.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. And I don&#39;t want this to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And thats fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />...make me and keep me that person. And that&#39;s the worst part of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Bro, I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Looking at something and saying, well, honestly, I just want to evaporate from all of this because.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s just, it&#39;s not. And at the end of the day...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I 1,000% get that, man. I wish that I could just go to another fucking country and no one knows me. I&#39;d love it because... But neither of us have that luxury. It&#39;s hard, all we can do is just change.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It makes me. It makes me feel terrible. And it makes me feel, and I can tell you that in the last handful of years that I have literally begged and prayed for anything else that could just come along and say, Just... There could be nothing like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Nike could come along and say, &quot;Hey, you want to come run our company?&quot; And I can say, &quot;as long as my family is taking care of the same way that they are, fine.&quot; Because I just can&#39;t physically and mentally, and not only those are my selfish reasons, but also because, I try to put myself in your shoes and think, I don&#39;t know, maybe just is this life, this relationship, this toxicity that makes us both this and this is not who we are. Because we&#39;re not, we weren&#39;t this, well before when we just knew each other at Metro. It was never these things. And so part of me takes that on personally of, well, fuck, I don&#39;t know if 98% of me caused all of this, then 98% of me just wants to back out of this because I don&#39;t want to do this to somebody else. I don&#39;t want to do it to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it. But in the end, I could change my name. And then we start over. And do you know what I mean? In the end, I want the same fucking thing. And the only way to make it happen is just to live it and...

I don&#39;t want you to feel trapped, man. You and I... I&#39;m not trying to do any, like, Stockholm Syndrome shit. But you and I figure out a way out of every fucking hole. And this hole is how do we just fucking figure out how to work smarter? We got this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I think whats cool is... The last thing that I want to say that I, actually I don&#39;t want to say it, is that especially just my own energy right now is I for real think that it&#39;s going to take 500% energy for the next I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s not months, maybe it&#39;s not. Maybe it&#39;s the next year. And I&#39;m not. I have no idea. But all I know is that I just want to put the fucking pedal down, figure out what needs to happen, because, not` only there was a guy who spoke at the thing that recently sold his he was in letter press and blah, blah, blah and actually one of the scariest things of it was the fact that he was talking about what he actually sold it for and it was fucking garbage and. If that&#39;s the reality, then like you said, that&#39;s the reality of us saying, well, is it time just to fucking pack it up and take it home because, what the fuck? What am I going to do with $200,000? Yes, I will do something with $200,000. But, like, if that&#39;s the reality of this, then. No, no, I just. I don&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s the reality, you know, if that&#39;s the reality of selling it. That&#39;s the reality of selling it. But there&#39;s also the reality of the milk not milking it, but keeping it alive through intelligent and minimal effort. And just try to figure a way to set it up that way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I just think that and this is no disrespect to you, but I think if that was the case, if I just as much as if you took yourself out of your role, what would happen to that side of the business if I took myself out of it? I don&#39;t... it&#39;s... it&#39;s..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, I know you... I know we say that, but in the end, it doesn&#39;t have to be Lucas and Joe clones. It could just be a business that is just really good at printing and you know what I mean? And w*e don&#39;t have to have. Fucking $150,000 deals going at all fucking times. You have a whole bunch of little ones brought to us by, you know, intelligent humans that we like being around, that we trust, which is hard.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I think what I&#39;m. I just need the help with that. I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t feel like again. It&#39;s in my own head but I don&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Should I, I&#39;ve never been to your place. I&#39;m willing to come out there. We could fucking work from there for a week or some shit. I don&#39;t give a fuck. And we could look into all this stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />How... Doesn&#39;t matter to me. However, I don&#39;t and it&#39;s not an immediate I mean, it is an immediacy thing. But also I just. On the higher level of things of just feeling like again, that it&#39;s not that you&#39;re not doing it, but I just feel so alone in thinking like, okay, well, how am I supposed to do it? I&#39;m not patting myself on the back saying, okay, well I do all of this and I do this at a high level and that&#39;s what we do. I don&#39;t want to fucking be in that seat. I was never supposed to be in that seat alone because I can&#39;t make those calls. And some of those calls that I can make are maybe not the right fucking calls.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And trust me I would be right next to you, I just feel like I am annoying or not annoying but like slowing you down, which don&#39;t take that the wrong way. I mean, like, I just feel like you. You know what you&#39;re doing and you don&#39;t need my input.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m happy to help you with any fucking decision because a lot of the decisions you make, I not, not that I&#39;m saying. I think they&#39;re bad, they shock me and they turn out great and that&#39;s the best part of collaboration. Sometimes you&#39;re going to make the same decision no matter what, but it&#39;s a lot easier when there&#39;s someone helping you make that decision, and I&#39;m always willing to do that.

We just need to feel we&#39;re both heard exactly the same and there is no skewing of, you know, you over me or me over you. I know that any suggestion you&#39;re going to give is for the betterment of the business. So it&#39;s just always going to be you and I. Just figuring out details. And yeah, dude, I don&#39;t want you to have... I feel bad, but it&#39;s also like &quot;don&#39;t go in there and ask Dad right now. He&#39;s in a bad mood&quot;. And we all know why Dad&#39;s in a bad mood, he was fucking working his ass off, and I get it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But, dude, a`ll I&#39;ve wanted was for us to share decisions and stuff and just keep doing things like it was the old days where we just fucking bounced ideas off each other and made them happen and shocked ourselves.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Oh, and don&#39;t make and I don&#39;t make decisions with the assumption of, &quot;Oh, fuck this, I&#39;m going to do this because he would have had a different decision.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no. And I don&#39;t think that at all. I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Even down to those, those heat presses, literally the decision was, okay, this is easier to do this because if we&#39;re going to be doing multiple, then we&#39;re not shipping these.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sure. I just thought it was weird because first of all, I was like, I would have told them, don&#39;t get the... I&#39;d tell them, get Hotronix. I don&#39;t like those Geo-Knights anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. Well, I mean that was also the pricing difference of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, Hotronix is a lot more?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, the Hotronix, I mean even just the regular like a the 16 by 16 is like $2,800. $2,600 or something. The hat. The hat ones are completely crazy unless you get the bogus black one. So the night ones were literally the least expensive that we knew know that work. I mean, that&#39;s also why I only got the 16 by 16 because we don&#39;t need the fucking enormous one. If they&#39;re going to be transporting, we don&#39;t have to deal with transporting it. And if it&#39;s something that is going to be like the idea of if they&#39;re going to be repetitive down here, we don&#39;t have to have two machines that are completely out of Chicago facility.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No and you could pull one off at last minute.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. And I get it. I understand...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was just like &quot;what is this?&quot; and then I go look at the Amazon and now I can&#39;t talk to you because you&#39;re mad at me for the other shit that... So I just let it go. And I apologize for not picking the phone up or even going to Texas. But I just thought, the way that it works for me is... ehhh, in a couple hours it&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It will be. I just like I said, I just wanted say something of like, hey theres just such.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just saw it being.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Like, Hey, there&#39;s such. There&#39;s such good conversation here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, for sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There&#39;s so many people honestly asked you... everyone... who doesn&#39;t know that it&#39;s both of us. Every person asked for you and I, and I felt bad again, feeling like this is me being in like a weird breakup of like, oh. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />He had some family things and he couldn&#39;t come. I mean, Bruce, for real asked me four times and I was like, he he had some family stuff going on and he was supposed to be here. And I don&#39;t even care. I mean, it bums me of not making excuses...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But there&#39;s also the weirdness that the arguing couple makes everyone feel, which is undeniable and unhidable, you know, and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />but I don&#39;t think that, I mean, I get it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And it adds more and more and more pressure. What are people really? I just I don&#39;t know. I just didn&#39;t think that that was the most intelligent...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I also just didn&#39;t want to be the only person coming back from this. Like, like I said, of like, cool. Remember all that shit I said about Marcotte? Yeah, let&#39;s bring him in now. And being like, well, now you&#39;re just making these ridiculous calls because, but it&#39;s like, no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No. When something&#39;s that drastic and you have stuck your neck out to make sure to let me know that you didn&#39;t like him and then something had to have happened to make you change. I trust you. I don&#39;t think that you took crazy pills. And stuff like that happens. Which is why I try to not make anything too final sounding.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah and I was just beat. And I think that, you know, just to sum up that whole thing, I think. I know you weren&#39;t saying it in an offensive way, but you saying I just want to go be with my kids was to me like, well, of course you don&#39;t think you think that honestly, at the end of the day that, like, I&#39;m choosing to be here?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no. I just. I hadn&#39;t. What I meant was, bro this thing is bummed me out so bad. And over what? I was supposed to be with the kids. It was their it was their weekend. I had to get Amy to take the kids, and I had to skip my mom&#39;s fucking birthday that fucking day, and Meadow went missing about 20 minutes before this happened and I had Amy blowing me up and I had to calmly talk her through all this shit. Meadow wasn&#39;t missing. It turned out that Amy had just called her, like, 15 times in under one minute. Meadow shows me the fucking screenshot. She&#39;s like &quot;she could track my phone. Here she is sending five or like it was like ten calls in one minute or something.&quot; And she&#39;s like, &quot;and here&#39;s my call back four minutes later.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So, they didn&#39;t want to be with her qnd I was just like, after hearing you be like, &quot;you know, it&#39;s the only time you&#39;re not chasing around my kid.&quot; And I was like. Okay. Loud and clear. I&#39;m going home. I should be with them anyway. And I get it. I understand the frustration of it&#39;s always something. I fucking get it. It I get so mad because it is so ridiculous. That, &quot;okay&quot;.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, and it was I mean, I was I was already bummed at the fact that my flight got all fucked up. So then I had every intention of like, we haven&#39;t had, how many times did I say, Cool, let&#39;s get in early Friday. Let&#39;s try to just go out to dinner just for you and I just to be able to go out and I&#39;m like, okay, well that got fucked up. Not because of the flight thing happened and I&#39;m like, whatever. The whole thing is falling apart.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s just...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It is what it is</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It is what it is, we are in two, the two of us are in situations that have us running hot a lot and we have a short amounts of... short amount of... short patience for nonsense whether the nonsense is real or not. And I get it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And there&#39;s two, I mean, it&#39;s look at the totality of what this year has been. And I&#39;ve tried to put myself again in your in your shoes so many times. And as much as I can be the dickhead at asshole, business guy over here that is insensitive to all of those things. It&#39;s not, because I get it. I&#39;ve seen the stress. I&#39;ve seen what, a nd all the unknown stress and all the other shit that I know that you probably went through. Going through, trudging through fucking hell and being there and also having to be on the other side of this as we&#39;re going through hell trying to keep our head above water, but also doing well the same way that we always do. And I get all of that. And I think that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, like just, just, just think of this. My favorite was I didn&#39;t live at the shop, but I have a fucking bed there that Nicole sees. And then out of nowhere, she fucking throws &quot;Oh, Joe used to live there, which is a sore point between you and I.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">And, and then, and then ten minutes later, you show me the screenshot of the guy from the hotel. And I was like, Oh, of course, of course. And I get it because there&#39;s no one at the hotel except that same jackass at the front desk. That&#39;s who you talk to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get it. And I&#39;m upset by how fucking comical it is every fucking... not every time I deserve sometimes. But actually, Meadow just texted me. Can you pick me up from school? That&#39;s weird. Oh, it&#39;s the snow.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />They closed the school already?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, no. She just doesn&#39;t want to walk home. School is over. Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea, I thought they were getting soft. First snow and everything shuts down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No meadows getting soft. Well, I&#39;m going to go get them. Bro. I could erase all memory of any history up to now and move forward and, I can move forward in a way that I would want to be treated. You know what I&#39;m saying? There&#39;s a way for both of us to be happy and It&#39;s stop inner fighting and whatever nonsense we have in our heads held back. That&#39;s old shit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What if there&#39;s legit. Like, what if we find just a business mediator?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I love it. I mean...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;">The fact that there&#39;s a business Therapist is hilarious.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t, dude. The more people in the fucking room, the more you and I have to be real. Hold on a sec. Hello? Hey. I&#39;m not at the shop. I mean, I&#39;ll leave now and I&#39;ll come grab you, but I might be a little, I&#39;m at my apartment, but I got to grab Choo-Choo. But. It might make her late. Me? Late for it. I mean, what time do you want me to get you? Right now? Okay. Is everything okay? Okay. No. And I figured that, uh. How about this? I&#39;ll come get you first. I&#39;m on my way. All right. Love you. Bye.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And it&#39;s cold. What? What? Huh? What? Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Uh, well, then let&#39;s do this. I mean, let&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Trust me. Dude, every day that goes by, I&#39;m shocked we&#39;re still doing this in the way that. I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve turned it into this. We&#39;ll figure it. We&#39;ll figure something out, man. We... we too beautiful to fight.</p><p><strong>cant put more energy into RBC but needs to go hard for next 10 years</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea we got our own... I just my my trajectory for my life and what my supposed plan is right now, if I can survive, is I just want to still for the next ten years, that&#39;s my mark of I&#39;m going to go fucking hard and then hopefully not have to go hard.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So whatever that is, I think that there&#39;s just the reality of all that we can do as this business is. I think that part of that will have to become trying to figure out what other. I don&#39;t even know what that is. What other outside things? Just because I think there&#39;s the cap of where we are, where we&#39;re going to be, what organization, you know, like how big something is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />When I was talking to to Brett from printed threads, which... their operation is small. I mean, it&#39;s... they&#39;ve got five presses in there and they&#39;re tight.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Could I switch to a phone call? Could I just call you?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. I just don&#39;t want to be late for getting Meadow. I&#39;ll call you. right. And then we could talk in the car.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>System Audio: </strong><br />Recording stopped.</p><h3 style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 18px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Sonix is the best automated transcription service online">Sonix </a>is the worldâ€™s most advanced <a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription service">automated transcription, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/translation?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated translation with Sonix">translation, and </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-subtitles-and-captions?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Easily create and edit subtitles with Sonix">subtitling platform. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/fast-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Fast automated transcription &amp; translation">Fast, </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurate automated transcription &amp; translation">accurate, </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/pricing?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Affordable automated transcription &amp; translation">affordable. </a></h3><h4 style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/best-aif-to-text-converter?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Automatically convert your aif files to text">Automatically convert your aif files to text </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-aif-to-text?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert aif to a txt file with Sonix">(txt file), </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-aif-to-docx?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert aif to docx with Sonix">Microsoft Word (docx file), </a>and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-convert-aif-to-srt?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Accurately convert aif to srt with Sonix">SubRip Subtitle (srt file) </a>in minutes. </h4><p style="font-size:14px!important;color:#3E3E3B!important;text-decoration:none!important;display:inline;"><a href="https://sonix.ai/" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Best automated transcription, translation, and subtitling service">Sonix </a>has many features that you'd love including <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="automatic transcription software" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/automated-transcription?utm_source=embed">automatic transcription software</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="enterprise-grade admin tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/admin-tools?utm_source=embed">enterprise-grade admin tools</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="generate automated summaries powered by AI" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/automated-summaries?utm_source=embed">generate automated summaries powered by AI</a>, <a style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" title="collaboration tools" target="_blank" href="https://sonix.ai/features/collaborate-with-teams?utm_source=embed">collaboration tools</a>, and <a href="https://sonix.ai/how-to-transcribe-a-zoom-meeting?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Quickly and accurately transcribe your Zoom meetings and recordings with Sonix">easily transcribe your Zoom meetings. </a><a href="https://sonix.ai/accounts/sign_up?utm_source=embed" style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Try Sonix for free today">Try Sonix for free today. </a>
