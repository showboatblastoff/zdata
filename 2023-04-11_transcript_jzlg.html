I am fine with the way things are, knowing what a nightmare it is to work with you because I know it&#39;s not you and I&#39;m hoping that you you make your way onto the other side of this instead of just demonizing me with the things that you are actually doing.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>projection, toxic, acct-weapon, </h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It is like... I can&#39;t understand how you don&#39;t realize how how ridiculous it is when you&#39;re jumping into the accounting email and just writing all sorts of crazy stuff. And then when I ask an actual question that is clearly to you, you... you... you say that I am being combative and make it so no one could do any business.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>call-out</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, you&#39;re in the broad daylight. Just because I just walk away when you do that stuff, when you do it in front of other people, especially other people that you&#39;ve already done it to before, it just lumps me in with your nonsense.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>both-sides</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s the &quot;I see both sides.&quot; There&#39;s no other side.

What are those?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />This is a this is a bait in... to to go off topic. I suggest you just read it yourself.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />(unheard)</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just saying I suggest... it&#39;s not it&#39;s not for me to decipher or put any fear in you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay? I mean, I&#39;m just. Okay, let&#39;s take it outside of the legal...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know we&#39;re way out of the legal... we&#39;ve been out of the legal realm for a long time.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />When I asked you what you want from me, I&#39;m asking you what are... so if you...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Nothing. Nothing. I want Lucas Guariglia, the person who I got the deal with. Now, that&#39;s not going to happen, we just got to figure out what you want to do, which it seems like you haven&#39;t done...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It seems like you did more planning of making me look like a lunatic than you did figuring out what you want to do after the thing all blew up. So you got to come up with everything and I got to look at it. I&#39;m not part of this. This is you. And I&#39;m saying I&#39;m here for you. I want to make sure that you&#39;re able to do what you need to do because we built something cool here, and I respect that. And I respect you. So you figure out what you want to do, dude. And I&#39;m not going to be unreasonable.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s fully just in my court to make a decision because I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How could that be in my court when I don&#39;t want any part of that? I mean...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Because you&#39;re part of the business.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying I can&#39;t also come up with your plan for you. You just got to... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even know what options are... like... dude, from what I read, you&#39;re tied to Rowboat for a very long time, even after... dissolution.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />(muffled)</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It 100% is. Did you look at at the time periods and all that stuff?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yes, I&#39;m well aware of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Like this situation is not... I mean, this shit happens all of the time, period.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know, but please, before you blow up my shit, don&#39;t run in half cocked and then be like, &quot;let&#39;s talk about what your plan is. Well, let&#39;s figure it out.&quot;

Figure it out. I mean...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It&#39;s not half cocked. My only... my only... the plan as of right now is the initial plan is a mediator in place that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, okay, that can&#39;t happen soon enough.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, Well, there&#39;s step one. That to me, I think, will be the precursor to what the next steps are. Because everything...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I know there&#39;s no reality... we... you and I could say whatever we want right now. It makes no difference in what you&#39;re going to do. So we 100% need the mediator because with no oversight, there&#39;s nothing to follow through on. I think you&#39;re going to wind up being stunned when the mediator comes in. Because there... by law, if you&#39;re not even if you&#39;re not upholding your part of the bargain, you have to pay for someone to come in and do your part of the role.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you feel? What do you feel? I&#39;m not upholding as my part of the bargain. It&#39;s an honest question.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />An honest question? Access to you. Any question answered at all? Any financial question answered at all. Any insight to what you are your plan is financially, I&#39;d say I don&#39;t get any of that. I... when these situations pop up, like exactly the way I said it did, and you decide to, you know, make something out of something, trying to see if I&#39;m going to lose it... I&#39;m going off again... forget it. It&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But it&#39;s not because I think even if there&#39;s a mediator or a therapist standing in front of us right now, if I&#39;m asking you questions of like, what are what are your what are your issues. Like clearly...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />First of all, you having to even ask that question is ridiculous.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You have an issue with me being in a different state?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />(sarcastically) No, no, no, no, no, no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Just exactly... the uh, misrepresenting the uh... the... let&#39;s take into consideration when I asked an accountant, that I am also paying, a financial question. And you jump in there and do that and make me look like that and make yourself look like that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That is part... that is number one. That is a huge one. You do not take into consideration anything. You have asked me zero questions for things that you went forward and done. That&#39;s a that&#39;s a problem... I mean, the funny part is I&#39;ll just let the mediator tell you. They&#39;ll tell you and you will be stunned.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Specifically what? I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />The amount of work that you&#39;re going to that that they&#39;re going to say is not being done by... by your side.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Again, you&#39;re going to have to you just got to talk to the lawyer. You&#39;ll...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know this mental block here where you can&#39;t see through the wall is the problem.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So they don&#39;t give a fuck. They literally even if it whatever, even if you&#39;re 500% correct and it is me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. And then they say then they say the person who wants to dissolve it is gets a default judgment by by a that a judge makes. And they take everything into consideration, including abandonment beforehand. So, I mean, again, I&#39;ll let your lawyers tell you, just read the thing and I think you might move back to Chicago if you took a look.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. And so and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s what you think is going to happen ultimately. You don&#39;t think that they will...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no. You keep asking... You asked me what I meant. And I explained. So that&#39;s my explanation. And like I said, I didn&#39;t even want to have to explain it to you because I knew that this would happen. Now you&#39;re mad at me for the the information I just gave you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m not mad at you at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Ugh.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t. That&#39;s that&#39;s fine. It doesn&#39;t. I know it&#39;s an opinion of information. It doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It&#39;s not an opinion. I just like, literally, I&#39;ve read it, like, 500 times. That&#39;s what it says. And and my lawyer about four years ago or whenever you move down there offered to write the abandonment letter. And I said, no, I guess I&#39;m a fool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, again.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just these are like... like exactly how you say they don&#39;t care? They don&#39;t. And that&#39;s why they go with leave it what&#39;s in place. They don&#39;t... hey don&#39;t say, &quot;I don&#39;t care. Blow the thing up.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I think they on either side of it, they could care less. They could say blow it up if you want to, if you want to keep it in court for 50 years and go ahead and keep paying us, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />At the end of the day, there&#39;s, their, their best interest is.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />To keep a society... no... their best interest is to protect the businesses. Because if partnerships, if someone&#39;s able to do that to someone, that means the government has to pay all the debts that these people wind up leaving. So that is why these laws are made to protect the government from having to pay for all the, you know, everyone filing for... um... what&#39;s the word? No, no, no, no. Not not dissolution. But when you got no money, whatever. Chapter eight, whatever. Five.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So regardless, if that&#39;s if that was my stance right now, I&#39;d say that&#39;s fine. Great. You&#39;re right. I&#39;m wrong on on every single... single part of it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I just want out. What would...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What would you like me to do?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, there just has to be a mediator. I don&#39;t know what the steps are. I mean, let me help you, like always. I&#39;m not saying that in a mocking way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m saying it&#39;s still the same Joe who wants to help you get to where you need to go. So let&#39;s call up the mediator. They&#39;ll tell us the steps. Anything I say is guesswork. I don&#39;t know, dude.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All I could ask of you is please... uh... conduct business in the normal manner and know that I am not your enemy. And there has never been any combative behavior.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />For you to call it combative is very telling because I&#39;m asking you legitimate shit. And it is by law... you have to answer those. You know that, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And now I know. I know you don&#39;t. I know you don&#39;t. Because I don&#39;t think if you did, you&#39;d be announcing all that stuff that you do to the accountants such as &quot;I owe you nothing. I have signed... I owe you no allegiance.&quot; Or however you worded it. Oh, dude. The allegiance we owe each other is... they&#39;re very hard on on how they judge that. So, I mean... I&#39;m... again... I&#39;m not trying to say anything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re going to do what... I want you to do, what you need to do. And I want to help you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So step one. Mediator. Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Number two: hey, can we start fucking working? You know that I&#39;m just here to work, dude. All this history and the history, when I ask you, what is the history? I don&#39;t have any history. What are you talking about? Dude, we&#39;ve hung out and done shit and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Was there ever a time that, like, we were ripped apart from each other? And then through some happenstance, we get brought back together and. And we have to recapture our love? No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You... you... you&#39;re a sales guy. Don&#39;t take it the wrong way, But you know what I mean. I don&#39;t even see you, dude. So all this we have history stuff is you have history. I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t know what this history is that you&#39;re talking about, because every single thing I remember is just you blaming immediately without checking into anything. And me standing there and just having to take it until you forget about it and get mad about something else. That&#39;s that&#39;s a history that I know. And I&#39;m still here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that, but it doesn&#39;t regardless of whose side... if it was the same, if I was telling you the same thing, it doesn&#39;t... the overarching conversation to me has always been the same thing of I don&#39;t care who&#39;s to blame.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I don&#39;t care. I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t care if it is me to blame. I&#39;m just here to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know so how do we...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is clearly a problem.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Is there? There&#39;s clearly a problem? You think having me as a business partner who does anything he can for the benefit of the two of us, even while being treated the way he does and not even asking for any change. It... it blows my mind. It&#39;s not &quot;I see both sides.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I&#39;m saying... I&#39;m not saying... I didn&#39;t just say you are... I&#39;m just saying a problem. A problem exists...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You... you have an issue. I get it. And somehow you... you&#39;ve put my face on it, and that&#39;s how you deal with it. But, that&#39;s fine. There&#39;s a problem. And whatever the solve is, let me know, dude. I mean. Do you even have any thought...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Like in your mind? What is your ideal? And if you feel like saying something now without representation, is painting you in the corner? I realize now as I&#39;m saying it, don&#39;t say anything, but just know, whatever your ideal outcome is, that&#39;s what I want for you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I understand that. I mean, I don&#39;t mean... to answer that question, I don&#39;t care if there&#39;s representation here or not. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s recorded or not recorded would be the same thing in saying I think that the those... those decisions I think will make themselves clearer.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Or maybe they or they don&#39;t. And if that&#39;s the case, then that is just the bridge to cross.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t there is no intention in in my mind to say... or energy to say that it&#39;s in my best interest to burn the entire thing to the ground. Because as I much as...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There definitely is There&#39;s definitely a reason to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What do you mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />To drive it down to nothing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Why? Why would that behoove me or you? I&#39;m not... I&#39;m not stupid. I mean..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, you&#39;re not stupid? You&#39;re letting the guy who&#39;s actually running the place over here wonder like... like someone wondering if they get paid for their paper route.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You got me wondering if I&#39;m going to be able to pay the outrageous amount of money that I owe every month and then put that in the trust of someone who says, &quot;I&#39;m not funding your lifestyle?&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Dude, we haven&#39;t even taken anything this entire year. I&#39;ve got like... I just... my paychecks and then... and you abandoned me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />How do you think all this stuff got done? It&#39;s the funny part is I make it so transparent. Like. Like, like so invisible to you. You don&#39;t even realize what I have to do while being treated the way you treat me. So. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m really rubbed the wrong way here. I don&#39;t know. I just keep going to that. I apologize.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I think that&#39;s that. I mean, that&#39;s fine. We don&#39;t need to address that, but there are issues in that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But yeah, I mean addressing it does nothing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But I&#39;m again will say the same thing that it&#39;s you sitting there wondering you... you&#39;re... you&#39;re wonderment is is is really just a question of what are the next steps and what is my...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. And I&#39;m... I will tell you that I&#39;m I&#39;m not sitting over here... I&#39;m not Pat Corcoran. I&#39;m not sitting here...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You 100%... you... you 100% are Pat Corcoran.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay. But if I was Pat Corcoran then I would have one: I would just let it burn into the ground because it doesn&#39;t matter to me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And I wouldn&#39;t need it for a source of income.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I can&#39;t help but feel like the only reason you called me is because I mentioned that law shit on video with her staring at the camera.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s great, if that&#39;s to your credit.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, 100%. No, I thought that maybe that made you have a come to Jesus moment and go look into what&#39;s really going on, and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, it didn&#39;t. And it&#39;s not and I&#39;m not I&#39;m not concerned about that. Like, that is not another.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. Clearly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. So, yes, I&#39;m not bothered by that. But to the point that I was trying to make, I&#39;m saying I&#39;m sitting. Yes, a state away in the exact same position of having taken no money besides the salarys.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I know. And there&#39;s... No one said you had to be the salesman. That&#39;s the problem. A salesperson would say, &quot;Hey, this is fucking hard. Maybe I should get a couple people to work below me or sub things out or come up with Joe a plan that takes sales away from salespeople and builds, you know, a new clientele that could find us through the Internet. I&#39;m doing that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And that&#39;s fine.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But no, but that is the responsible... That&#39;s your responsibility. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />It is my responsibility.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I can only say that my only reluctance in doing that is because... if to me I have certain paths that...options...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. So... so the reason you didn&#39;t do that is because you want to keep your pathways open in the future is exactly what I&#39;m saying.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, no, not at all.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That is what you just said. And that is exactly my point.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No, my... my decision is to say that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s always been on the table.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, but why...why say no to salespeople? Why say no to anyone to help you? Why? Is that responsible?
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You built your own hell and I... I keep trying to throw ropes down to you. Um. Regardless.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We just got to figure out what we got to do. I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. I mean, I can&#39;t I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on with the bank account. And I say that in... I&#39;m going to have to get one if this if this game plays out and I have to take all of this stuff into consideration.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And guess who is my lynchpin with all the information on the thing? Mr. Helpful you and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be very. I&#39;m being ridiculous.
</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m here to help.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m sorry. It is what it is, homie. The answer is... there&#39;s nothing to talk about. Um. I&#39;m not mad. In the least. Guarantee you by when? Whatever day it is. Give me two days, I forget. But, I want you to be happy, dude. Um, so... whatever steps there are, I&#39;m here to help. In the meantime let&#39;s go out with a bang.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I agree with that. And I... but I will tell you that regardless of if you want to see the side of here&#39;s me dragging my feet or not doing this or abandoning.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Lucas, you can&#39;t even talk to me literally, you can&#39;t you can&#39;t answer any question that I have to the point that it&#39;s dehumanizing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And what do I do? I&#39;ll still answer your question. As fast as I can. On purpose, knowing that the reason you&#39;re asking me, I know how hard it is when we&#39;re in that situation, how hard it is to ask me for anything. And that is why I know it&#39;s that dire that I give it to you that fast. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The only questions that I&#39;m that I&#39;m not answering for you are questions that I don&#39;t know the next steps to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know and that&#39;s fine, bro. Whatever. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But it&#39;s not. And I understand.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I mean, I&#39;m saying that that will make itself apparent. When it needs to. You know what I mean?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, I mean it&#39;s clearly apparent that the...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, no...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />There is an issue to be tended to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no. I&#39;m saying what I mean is we get the the mediator and they&#39;ll tell us what to do. And we do it as they tell us. You know what I&#39;m saying? That&#39;s what I meant.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Saying we could sit here and guess I have zero ideas what the steps are. So. And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t mean to leave it in your court. My... my...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Have you seen the new John Wick?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, because I was going to John Wick you. I was going to say &quot;I have served and I will serve.&quot; That is what all the the hitmen say when they&#39;re confronted by the high table. You know, they&#39;ll they&#39;ll go do whatever the high table says. Because they&#39;re they&#39;re bound. So no matter like if they&#39;re like, go kill your mother, they&#39;ll they, they kneel down and say, &quot;I have served and I will serve&quot; and they&#39;ll walk over and kill their mother.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Jesus Christ.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Which, fucking... dude, that movie. Amazing. Fucking hilarious. There&#39;s a scene of Keanu Reeves rolling down the stairs for about five straight minutes. It like in the theater. The crowd was dying because it&#39;s a... it&#39;s a... I think it&#39;s a real stairwell in France that&#39;s supposed to be some insane stairwell.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But either way, dude, it&#39;s still us. We got it. Um, we&#39;ll make sense of it. Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I do I do need you to understand that the... And this is not me making it.... You&#39;re welcome to call fucking Henry. The... what is happening in the industry and what is out there is. Is an absolute, real fucking problem. And it has nothing to do with me directly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, my God. Wait. Oh, shit. Shit. Lucas. Oh, my God. Charlotte just texted me &quot;on your way?&quot; I&#39;m supposed to be picking her up in a minute, dude. We&#39;ll make it through it. Okay? I love you. We&#39;ll make sense of it. Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All right. I know... I know how hard it was to call, and I appreciate it. And that&#39;s why I picked up. So... I&#39;m here, bro.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All right. Let me I mean, I guess we&#39;ll.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I mean, I could keep talking, but I just I got. I got supposed to be there in 15.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But, Lucas, please know. All this &quot;Angry Joe&quot; shit is not real. It never has been.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I&#39;ve tried to, um... there&#39;s no changing your mind on it, all I could do is just back out of the situation. I stopped parking in those parking spots, even though every single time it was proved that the other person was blaming me for some shit when I wasn&#39;t even there. Or, you know, my favorite was the person blaming me for breaking into the coffee shop. And then everyone jumps down my throat. And then I said, &quot;Did anyone check the cameras?&quot; when the guy is standing there, and he goes &quot;Well, okay, okay.&quot;</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was like, &quot;What? No one even looked for the fucking cameras?&quot; And I go &quot;now what happens to the guy who just blamed me?&quot; Joe, just move on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Uh, what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If I didn&#39;t point the cameras out? I was going... they were... they&#39;re roping me up. Just know it&#39;s hurtful and I&#39;ve told you, it&#39;s like the hardest thing for me.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Um, but. I get it. Um. We&#39;ll figure it out, bro. And...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m open to everything. All right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, let&#39;s figure that out, because I don&#39;t know what that... and I told you, I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t feel comfortable with it being just in my court to say, okay, cool, then here get you mediators.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Do you want... do you want me to find... mean I&#39;ll find some too. I mean.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Think you should find three and I&#39;ll find three.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Love it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I think...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I love it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Figure out what that is because I don&#39;t...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We&#39;ll pick the one with the funniest accent. Deal.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Um. Yes. I would... I would talk to Henry? Because he&#39;s in same exact situation and sales are sales.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I know. I know. And that is why I have an actual different plan.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve through the night, been trying to build my way through this. And there is a plan 100%.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />That&#39;s fine. I appreciate and respect that. But also I&#39;m just asking for you on the other side, just to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No. I know, I know. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />You don&#39;t know here what I&#39;m doing, but it&#39;s... it&#39;s... if again, whether I&#39;m a cousin of... of Corcoran or not, I am not in a position to say...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m fucking with you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Every single conversation that I&#39;ve had, you know, whether my dad said the same thing, the reason that he called you, which I also specifically told him to not call you. But I...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And I didn&#39;t... I love your dad. I was so glad that he did call me. In that there is a reality and I see... And I&#39;m sorry... I really got to jump out here. I&#39;m on this weird speakerphone thing. I can&#39;t, like, walk out of the network. But we&#39;ll pick up. Dude, I&#39;m here if you want to talk in the middle of the fucking night, I&#39;m here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />All right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />All right. Take care.
