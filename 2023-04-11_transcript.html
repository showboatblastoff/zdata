Did you just see it?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I saw the other side.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I always have that, so I&#39;m not turning around. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Ah.

Now it&#39;s official.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah, and now we&#39;re good.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Now that we&#39;re cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah, you got a little preview. Um,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Hello.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So. So I, um, we can we can jump into it. Um,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sure.</p><p><strong>SM referring to the notes/script LG emailed here before meeting :

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z9aBn5bFI3pvl3hQ5Hl98H36aeWvX5ok&usp=drive_fs</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I gave you guys a nice little, long little list of some things that I wanted to cover and, and some a a pretty long, uh, document of financials. Um, so I know that previously I had done, like, different, uh, dashboards and things like that. So, I know that was a little bit of a different format. Um, so I just want to make sure that you guys were able to take a look at that and that, um, you know, just kind of take it from there.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>LG gives hint to SM to jump to talking points</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I think either or works. I mean, I think if we want to go with the, the dashboard, um, it doesn&#39;t, doesn&#39;t really matter to me. I think as long as there&#39;s a consolidated place that we know that we should be looking for. But, I mean, this is fine if that&#39;s easier.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Okay, perfect. Um, so for the purposes of this meeting, I think that, um, with the reports that I sent that&#39;s going to have, like, everything that I kind of wanted to, um, that I wanted to touch on. So that&#39;s going to have, um, we&#39;re, we&#39;re really drilling into like, cash flow that are the AP, um, you know, the, the profit and loss comparisons, the percentages, um, all that stuff. And we can kind of see, um, you know, the revenue streams, um, cost of goods and stuff like that. So, um, I feel like that would be a solid place to, to kick things off and to kind of just start running down that list of, um, items that I wanted to go over. And then, um, we can kind of jump into, um, anything that you guys have questions on or wanted to cover. Does that sound good?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sure.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yep.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>SM says RBC is at 75% COG, LG only sales person</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Okay, perfect. Um, so basically, the first thing that, you know, I see when I look at this and I&#39;m sure that, um, you guys both would see when you look at this is that, um, that we have, you know, and I can share my screen if that&#39;s easier, if you or if you guys are following along. Um. Is that we have a very high, um, cost of goods percentage currently.

So what we&#39;re running at is, um, 75% right now. Cost of goods through to date, um, on a cash basis. So basically, like, if we had $1,000 come in immediately, uh, you know, 750 of that is is taken up by the, the process of putting out your product. Um, so that&#39;s going to make it really hard to, to be profitable. 

Um, so I just kind of wanted to see what your thoughts were on that, if that was a surprise to you, if you were expecting that, um, and just kind of drill into that a little bit because my main goal would be to. Reduce that. Um, because we&#39;re going to, you know, obviously you&#39;re going to have overhead wages, rent, uh, marketing, anything else that comes after that, it&#39;s going to take away from that remaining 25%.

And if you think about that, you&#39;re just going to be operating at a deficit after that point. If you only have 25% of your total gross revenue to to draw on for, you know, everything outside of your your cost of goods to produce your product.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. What I was going to just jump in with was uh, so I, I actually I finished importing all our POS and everything and they&#39;re... everyone is now attached in a database, not yet officially in QuickBooks, but it shows us the profitability of every single job. 

And you could just look at it and and not only the profitability, you could look at the how much we paid for shipping, how much the, uh, the fees were, how much, uh, the goods were. And it pulls it all out.

And the first thing I was finding was some of the costs of goods were so shockingly high. And then for us to make, like, nothing on it. We were just, like, shoveling money to the distributors to sit and wait and, uh, on, on product. But, uh, I mean. Those were. Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So I mean, I thats the thing...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Understand the logic of, you know, when, when you&#39;re hungry, you, you start grabbing anything that&#39;s in front of you. And it makes sense. But it&#39;s more... it&#39;s not about looking at that top number. We got to start concentrating on, because I found I found a bunch of jobs that were shockingly, shockingly, uh, profitable ones that ones that are that pass through our doors that were just like, &quot;oh, whatever. Oh, that got done? I didn&#39;t even see it.&quot; There is quite a few of those. But no, I agree. I didn&#39;t mean to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No, I want I definitely want to, um, here, I&#39;ll share my screen so we can just pop in. Um, no, I definitely want your feedback because that&#39;s that&#39;s I don&#39;t want to just talk at you guys. Like, I want to talk with you guys. Um, so. Um. That&#39;s great. To drill into like by project and by client. Like obviously I want we want to see that. And I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got it going back. I didn&#39;t mean to cut you off. I got it going back to 2019 so we could look at our what we considered the good years and what was going on and figure out how to recreate the the golden years.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Absolutely. What changed and things like that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah</p><p><strong>JZ went back and recategorized every order to make uniform, so books work correctly</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So I think that&#39;s super important. And definitely one of the things that I found, you know, was happening as if I, if I were to look in here and look at, like your products and services and the way that it&#39;s things were, mapping in, in your accounting. So I&#39;m sure that you have your, like, what you guys use to, kind of look at things and to get, get kind of like a feel for the health of the business and stuff like that. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re, if you guys were doing that or if you were, like, relying on your financials to kind of tell you that story? But, you know, going forward, now that you have spark with you, you would want to be relying on your kind of financials to be telling you that. And a lot of these things like where these product, details were mapping to weren&#39;t... it wasn&#39;t really, coordinating to like what the description was or what the item was. And so like, for example, like if you have, like service fees for, like live printing or something like that and it&#39;s going to, like this bucket of fees and fees are also, like bank fees or, something else. I started to just kind of break that out so that we could get a better idea of what the different revenue streams are and then what the costs are associated with them, and to really break it out, so we could kind of get into more.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sorry. I was just going to say those all, the way that they are now are from multiple different accountants. You know, just guessing those mean nothing to us. So if if there&#39;s a uniform way to flip them all to make sense. I haven&#39;t looked at the books since, we handed you the keys. I never looked back.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, yeah. So I think that, you know, being able to, I think that, you know, less is more in a lot of ways. And so to, kind of drill into what, what are your, niche sales categories like, and what you guys are currently doing, and kind of remove the stuff that you&#39;re not doing. So we can kind of, you know, let the, the other things kind of fall away and we can really just kind of not have it. So, so called or have the opportunity for other things to get kind of evolved in there and things like, you know, if you have, you know, like if custom tags and things like that are like an upsell moment where you&#39;re kind of doing that customization to have it go to, like a generic category of like custom, where we could drill into more like, what is the cost of doing these tag upsells and like things like that and have like tags be a sub category of custom and things and just to kind of like drill in.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Would it be helpful if you and I just like, went in like made a Google sheet and mocked out like, like a sketch of, you know, item, where does it go? And we can just make like a little tree by using the cells, you know what I&#39;m saying? And that will help, like, like maybe I could help you visualize the path of how money, you know, makes its way through our invoices.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, I think that that would be super helpful. And what I can do is I can export, you know, what&#39;s currently in here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Umhmm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And to get rid of like what doesn&#39;t need to be here, I think would be really important.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Sure.</p><p><strong>SM tries to figure out what went wrong with cash flow

JZ calls out LG ordering overseas for his Wifes Employer Constellation</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />But to also kind of like look at, you know, I mean obviously there&#39;s going to be a lot of things that are like, you know, garments. And I was, you know, moving those things to garments and various apparel and things like that. But like to look at, you know, the difference between, like, embroidery, whether that is contract decoration or if you&#39;re doing embroidery in-house and, like, things like that, like, I just don&#39;t I&#39;m not quite sure about that because it&#39;s, you know, you guys know better than I do.

But to kind of, you know, start to understand a little bit more what these numbers represent, to be able to kind of, understand where we got to 75% cost of goods. 

Like what? What happened?

Is it the pricing? Where is the pricing wrong?

Is it too... Is there too much to outsource?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There seemed to be, there seemed to be a movement towards making a lot of this branded stuff overseas. And that, I mean, I came across so many that were so high priced for, like, Dyson and a couple other places like that where the turnaround, it was like we were paying $40 for the item. And then charging them like $44, you know, and it was like, whoa, that is so high.

And same with The North Face stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Hmm. Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, yeah, I get it. But it&#39;s like we can only charge so much for embroidery. So, you know, I saw a bunch that had these coats that were like, you know, over 100 something dollars each. And we did like $2 of embroidery on it, which I, I get you got to take the little jobs with the big jobs. And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s because or we&#39;re taking these jobs, there&#39;s a bigger picture. Like, you know, a lot of people give us garbage, tiny jobs, in order to string us along for the big ones. And and I get we&#39;re always trying to take as much as we can, but what I&#39;ve been doing over the last two weeks is I&#39;m working on a new platform to try to drive sales from the broader base of... online customers. Sorry. My screen just went off.

I got it streamlined. It&#39;s I&#39;m really understanding the APIs and pushing stuff back and forth and scraping the info, and I&#39;ve been running all the queries. It&#39;s awesome. I could actually pull up, a sales person, the year and look at how they, they did per customer.

And like, you could put different, it builds like little charts against themselves, but with all this automation and stuff. I think that if we get away from it being sales based, in that someone has to go woo a giant customer to make it monthly. I mean that that&#39;s a lot of the reason we&#39;re in the trouble we&#39;re in now, which I 1,000% get when someone&#39;s got the money out in front of you, you take it. And well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />That&#39;s not so. That&#39;s kind of the the opposite of what I&#39;m saying. So I, I, I don&#39;t want you to just take anything.</p><p><strong>SM states JZ's automation and analysis data is going to be enormous</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, that. No, no we don&#39;t. We want to get away from that. And the way I think to do that is with this online system where as people find us, that&#39;s more revenue making its way to us in a general way, because that&#39;s the way they find everyone else. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s, you know, the Culture has some hotshot guy who goes and recruits every customer. There&#39;s, you know, just online portals and this and that. And if we have that running in the background at, you know, anything big on top of it is just cake.

So I have a whole system with that and I got it, I got it now where the emails that come in from Future Shirts automatically turn into an invoice with their exact pricing and everything. And, and it could API back into their system so we don&#39;t have to play with their their system is goofy. So I&#39;m going to talk to Carmel about plugging into theirs, and it&#39;ll be killer.

Lucas, I&#39;ve also figured out how to get into the messaging in Printavo. So when you want to message a customer, it goes through the Printavo messaging, bypassing any phone numbers or any of that kind of stuff. And it&#39;s all trackable in the job, like going back. But I mean, I...

I think by opening more doors to regular revenue that&#39;s not so hard to get will be very helpful.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I... yeah, I definitely think that you&#39;re automation work is going to be enormous, and I think that&#39;s the way that everybody&#39;s going towards.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And I think that you should definitely, continue to move forward with the automations and things like that. And, and that&#39;s awesome. Like, I think that that is, definitely the way to go.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And you want to continue to pursue that. But what I want you guys to also take a look at is like, for those projects where that you mentioned, where it&#39;s like, you know, the North Face jackets, and the embroidery on it. So that would be almost the equivalent of the customer supplying the garments, like you&#39;re not making a markup on the garment</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Or the apparel like, so you would want to start like separating that out into, like customer supplied garment or something to that effect, or even have the customer, you know, their card is charged for the North Face stuff, since it&#39;s such a pass through to you in terms of profitability. 

And so it&#39;s things like that where you&#39;re like, okay, so if we if, if the cost for, the North Face jackets and the, you know, the resale price for them are basically just a pass through and we&#39;re not making any money on this, this aspect of it.

We&#39;re going to look at this, you know, revenue stream. As you know, the goods are supplied by the, the client and it&#39;s just the in-house embroidery service or whatever.

So what is that like, how much money are we making on that? How, um, lean are we running on that? What&#39;s the production turnaround time like the cost for that? Is it, you know, outsource whatever. And then that&#39;s how you lean into the profitability of that job was because the Colas are a pass through like right. The garment, it&#39;s not even there. And you could actually have your client. You could be like, here&#39;s, we need your card...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />North Face is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You&#39;re paying for this. We&#39;re not covering the cost of it because it&#39;s basically a pass through. So something like that. And then, you know, as you drill into the details of the different revenue streams, you know, like the those types of, garments supplied by clients, like for the sake of this conversation,  versus, you know, you know, something else that&#39;s really profitable for you guys or something that&#39;s, you know, like live printing and it&#39;s completely different and you really like niche down into those things. You can look at what your, ideal client looks like and what that looks like from start to finish to really try to understand, you know, what you want from not only these, like, niche, you know, revenue streams within the company, but who is a good fit for you guys and, and who isn&#39;t.

And sometimes that will, you know, saying no is, a fiscally responsible thing to do sometimes because if it if it doesn&#39;t, like, make money, it can be losing money and it can be taking you from, you know, that ideal or dream client. And that&#39;s like an exercise that, you know, we have all of our clients do is like, you know, coming up with your dream, you know, job, per niche and client, and you can&#39;t always have that. But it&#39;s a good thing to try to strive for and kind of keep in mind, because if you have someone who&#39;s so, like, against what you&#39;re going for, then maybe that is the moment to be like, you know what? We&#39;re not aligned. But I can give you my competitor who I don&#39;t like number, and deal with them.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I do that here and there. But, one one other thing that I was thinking about is do you think by driving customers away from trying to use credit card, we wind up in this A/R nightmare in the first place?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />By driving them away from supply, supplying their own goods?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no. For charging with credit card.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />For you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Paying for the goods up front with credit card?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No no no no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Are you accepting credit cards as payments for A/R?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Exactly. Exactly are like, I feel like like. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Um.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Like there&#39;s like... I get that a lot of, like another effect of these really high ticket orders is then the credit card processing gets to be really high. If there&#39;s credit card processing involved, which everyone seems to just always assume it&#39;s always credit card. And if we put the credit card fee into our pricing and it&#39;s we&#39;re just always doing better when when someone uses cash. Do you think that there&#39;s more of a benefit to just keep paying us, just keep paying us credit card, just keep paying us credit card instead of playing with the the guy who cuts the checks on Tuesday. You know what I&#39;m saying?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No, honestly, like the, there was like a real movement towards like, we don&#39;t want to accept credit cards and this and that and like, oh, fees are astronomical and, and things like that. And that was like a very, strong wave that was happening like very pre-COVID. And people were, you know, kind of leaning in that direction, but, you know, since, like 2020 or so, it&#39;s, I feel like the resistance has really died down and it&#39;s just an accepted norm.

And the fees are kind of leveling out as well. And the the convenience of immediately receiving payment via a credit card and automation, greatly outweighs that two and a half to 3% credit card fee.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And like, chasing a check or having it bounce like the amount of uncertainty that is available in like a check being in the mail or something like that is, is never ideal.

You know, ACH is always great.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Umhmm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Like, you can definitely, you know, keep your ACH clients that, you know, directly deposit into your account. That&#39;s always wonderful and typically doesn&#39;t come with a fee. So we love them as clients, but those, you know, not everybody does that. So, um, I just really think that the convenience and speed and turn around and things like that, with, with credit card processing is just not worth the you know, two and a half to 3% of the, of the cost. So most people have just kind of given up that fight.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Is there anything new that anyone&#39;s doing any new, like payment technology that we don&#39;t know about, that everyone&#39;s accepting?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No, I mean, the, the main thing that I see in, in screen printing is that everyone&#39;s been forced into Printavo, basically. But, um, it seems like you guys have done Printavo. This is one of the things I don&#39;t think I put it on the agenda, but, you guys have been you guys did Printavo and now you&#39;re kind of on stripe, which is outside of Printavo. Is that, how is that going? How are you guys not being forced into Printavo payments?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well, we talked to them, and Lucas wanted to get, them to match, our... our..</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />The fees?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah, from the other place, but it&#39;s so ridiculous and bizarre that they can&#39;t explain it to us, and there&#39;s no documentation to explain it to us. So having them match it is hard. And I think, you know, we were there was a meeting set up, but it&#39;s so complicated to figure out that it&#39;s just slipped past us. They told us that we would, they would never shut us off.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But they&#39;d keep poking at us.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. So their, their fees are definitely high, but I feel like there&#39;s this...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Printavo you&#39;re talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. But they&#39;re going to start to level out. I think it&#39;s like a a startup thing for them, and they&#39;re not, because they&#39;re so new, they&#39;re... the... the PCI, like the compliance that&#39;s behind them that is real. Like they&#39;re not, established. And so they&#39;re passing on the crazy rates that they have because they, they need to be supported by the, the federal banks and things like that. And so they, they&#39;re probably paying a much, much higher rate than, you know, these established, like stripes and things like that, like the regular merchant account. So that is part of it and it will start to level out. But right now, yeah, it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s much higher. And that&#39;s the reason it&#39;s not because they&#39;re just being, you know, arbitrary with it. It&#39;s, it&#39;s because they&#39;re new and unestablished and they need to have a certain amount of like, history, and background to be able to get into a more stable rate. So if that gives you like any kind of peace of mind about that, like that, it will adjust and they will pass it on, so...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I just know, like the easier things become, the the easier it is to get someone to hit yes on it. So I&#39;m just wondering what&#39;s new.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. No, that, um, that everything I&#39;ve seen with the Printavo payments, like they&#39;re, they&#39;ve been really great and they&#39;re going to start to do the, the newest thing with the Printavo payments is that like, and I don&#39;t think you guys don&#39;t even have online hosted stores to you like merch stores. Do you have it here and there?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not really.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We&#39;ve built them before for our customers and it just became, I don&#39;t want to do this anymore.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, that&#39;s, that&#39;s been like a huge issue for Printavo with, like, their payouts and things like that. And like, it&#39;s like you can&#39;t turn a quote into an invoice and like, sync it as, like a huge it&#39;s a huge kerfuffle over there for them that they, they finally were able to figure it out. And, and online store like merch stores are going to be able to come over with their online payments and as is finally happening. But I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s really going to be a big moment for you guys, because I don&#39;t think it really affects anything that you&#39;re doing. But that&#39;s like the the hot new thing that&#39;s happening and in here. But aside from that, there&#39;s really nothing. Nothing new. And it could just kind of as, like an accepted thing, but the, the place that I would really, you know, kind of look into, you know, we talk about payroll and things like that, but, you know, looking at, you know, production salaries being 20%, that&#39;s not, exorbitant to me that that seems, pretty reasonable. But we need to kind of drill into all of the other items. And that&#39;s part of what I was breaking down, because if we look at these line items and they&#39;re not, they&#39;re not real or they don&#39;t make sense or they&#39;re not actual to like, what? Like if we look at what it would look like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Do you want me to look in them and just pull the reports and look and see if they make sense? I mean, I could very easily do that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. No, I mean, I mean, more like for, you know, to compare apples to apples. Like, if we say, oh, you have...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh from...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Like, you know, there&#39;s $57,000 in promo sales. And then when we categorize costs,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />It&#39;s like, well, that&#39;s a great margin because you spent $122 on promo.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Gotcha.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So we just I want to kind of, you know, be able to take pieces of your revenue and then have a customized cost associated with it so we can drill into the thing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Cool.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So it will be collaborative. But I want to just, you know, get that get that done together. And this was, this is already like, I can show you I think you have copies of previous ones, but this is already, pretty cleaned up. And I know, you know, a lot of the vendors and I know a lot of the things. So I can basically deduce, but just kind of, working on breaking out the invoices and line items so that you&#39;re, um, able to capture as much markup and, differentiation for the different things that you sell and market, like, so, like, I like my random, example was like the tags, the tagging that that should be, you know, a extra line item or definitely marking that up. You know, things like that and that fees are all separate for all the different things they are.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I was going to ask you with the fees. That&#39;s what I was going to ask you about the fees. Sorry. I think there&#39;s, like, a sync thing. In fees when, when we put them at the bottom, I did notice that, sorry a text just threw me off. I did notice that when it comes across the bottom, as opposed to like if we&#39;re putting the shirts, you know, in the line items, and then sometimes we&#39;ll put our setups like right under the shirts. Those fees up there versus the fees towards the bottom. They seem to come across completely different. And where should we be putting what fees? Because I know when we put the fees it in with the line items, A: it throws off the count for when we go to production because it thinks, like, if we put there&#39;s embroidery 40 pieces. And then I had the Jose under there for 40 pieces. It will add any numbers that are showing up with the line items. So setups and all that stuff. Like if we have like two setups it it counts those as like items. So...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And should we be using the same drop down version every single time we use a fee. Like, is there some like, guesswork that comes in? You know what I&#39;m saying, from Printavo to QuickBooks.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No. So yeah, so it is. I think your front line, like Printavo needs to be, you know, organized in a way that makes sense for you guys. It makes sense for, you know, your team and it makes sense for your deliverable. And then the back end will be, you know, me, obviously, I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll make it tell the story of the financials and we&#39;ll get it coordinated. But like, like an example is like these are all it&#39;s a whole bunch of socks and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />The place that it&#39;s going to is, is promo items, so...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Those were promos technically to us, those are promo items because those are produced like overseas and it&#39;s the same system.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Perfect.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You know what I&#39;m saying? So. So that that&#39;s actually correct.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. And it&#39;s like the, the tray and like things like that. So</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />That is perfect. And then this is like a, you know, fleece, crewnecks, different sizes and things, things like that. So let&#39;s look at the price. Yeah. So these are like, individual, looks like shirts or whatever and it&#39;s going to screen printing. So it&#39;s like that is wrapped up together with the price, with the sales price</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Of a of like a garment and apparel. So breaking out like what, how much is, like the actual, you know, service fee versus the cost of the garments, to, to break out, like, production and, you know, all that good stuff. So that&#39;s just kind of drilling into like the, the details of this and like where would the actual...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And is that something that we would, that we would that, that you&#39;re, that you&#39;re in the process of doing or is that something you need some help determining?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Well, so if your front end like if I click on this invoice. So, like, if this invoice comes over. You have, like, the the ink change. Set up fees. There is not a differentiation between like art or like the the service that is the screen printing is all it&#39;s combined with the, with the sale of the shirt and it&#39;s like all put together. So there is no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Um, you know what&#39;s crazy, though? Is it, it when we&#39;re building it, if you go to the item as it&#39;s being built, you could hover your mouse and it shows you the amount that&#39;s. Of like where that final dollar, you know, 10.72 is coming from when you hover over it, it&#39;ll it&#39;ll show cost of goods and then it shows you your markup that you have it. Do you know what part I&#39;m talking about?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah so in Printavo so...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Like, I&#39;m saying, if that&#39;s there, maybe if you could access that, that would be true. You know what I mean? Because you would be getting you&#39;d be able to get the actual markup and everything.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. So I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see that in here. And it&#39;s like it&#39;s different for each um, like Bella + Canvas shirt or whatever.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You&#39;re in Quickbooks. I&#39;m saying when know when we&#39;re in Printavo when you&#39;re building.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />When your building? Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />When you&#39;re in the back end.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. So like so that would be like one of the things,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />But it would be like to, to be very specific about like your markup for your garment is is going to be the 35% or whatever. But then in addition to that, you&#39;re covering your production, labor costs and all the screen printing material costs and things like that. So that that is very intentional and, and pricing and things like that. And because managing the costs.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Basically right now, Lucas, yours is what, like you&#39;re like, is it 40 and 45 that it you automatically use or, or is there a formula.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />For garment markup?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. Like you know what I&#39;m talking about right. When you hover and it&#39;ll show you that little breakout like...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah. I so I think that the concern is that because when we set up Printavo there obviously is it has its matrices that you can put in. You know, here&#39;s how it&#39;s driving and the pricing of what the garment is. So if it&#39;s 35%, 40% markup of the garment then plus it&#39;s being, it&#39;s the price is being driven by the matrix that we have for kind of the the printing cost.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />100% agree. If we can get, if that can be drilled down into.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Umhmm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />but I don&#39;t I mean short of obviously unless we&#39;re doing something that Printavo is not feeding that to QuickBooks, I think the only way to be then doing that is if in that actual invoice we have the line item for the garment, then we&#39;re breaking out the line items for the actual decoration cost. And that&#39;s fine when it comes to the contract side of it, because the garments are zero. So it doesn&#39;t matter. And those those contract customers, they know they&#39;re expecting that. So if it&#39;s $1.40 for front print, $2, whatever it is. But you know, if that&#39;s been an ongoing thing for years of like wrapping that all into an end user to. </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, and...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Just see 1072 versus the itemized price, because it just opens up a way bigger conversation of, well, why is, you know, I can find the shirt online for $3 and, you.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Absolutely. No I don&#39;t want you to show your client that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, no, no.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, I&#39;m saying in the back end the the sale is made. Forget everything, that data went that you&#39;re hovering over exists. What I&#39;m saying is we suck that out. And we could have our own just little charts that show us. What&#39;s actually happening. I would never show the customer that stuff. I&#39;m saying for drilling down,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yea so we&#39;re all on the same page.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We&#39;d be able and I could even have a thing that when it hits QuickBooks, there&#39;s all these QuickBooks API things that I could say when, when, when Printavo Order X hits, QuickBooks go to, and I could have it read the information and make it correct the way you want to see it in QuickBooks. Like like you know what I mean? Like automated. It just catches it and will reformat it correctly, making up for the Printavo stuff, not passing correctly.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. Perfect. If that&#39;s easy enough.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I mean, it just what my my end goal is to...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Is there a way that we could see, like a ideal invoice that you would get from us? And I could make everything, I could judge from how to make it show up like that? Do you know what I mean? Like like,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />If you&#39;re like, the, the line items are by themselves. And then below it is the garments and then you know what I mean. Like, because other sections.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />It doesn&#39;t even have to be, for, for me necessarily. It&#39;s more like it&#39;s it&#39;s for you guys</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So that I can, if you can show me what you already have, where it says that and I can, I can go into your pricing matrix, too, and try to see if I can pull that. But I just want to make sure that this is something that&#39;s, you know, updated regularly and, and looked at because if, if I&#39;m looking at, you know, the details, like I showed you and, you know, if, if the total cost of production labor is not too, too crazy, then it&#39;s all of the other items that are kind of making up the, the cost driving that too high. So we have, like, the contracted labor, the outside services, the, you know, total apparel costs, then all these, you know, little guys that probably need to be drilled into a little bit more to have the direct materials, to come up with the 76%.

So it&#39;s just, you know, as long as you guys are comfortable knowing that, like you have delineated the markup and the, the fees, the costs of that and that they&#39;re aligned to what, you know, what the costs are for them. And, you know, if you have to increase your product price, you, you know, have to do that, that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That, that percentage, that 76% that you&#39;re talking about, that 76% of total revenue coming in or money coming in, or is that like, like meaning if if we sold more stuff and our... nothing else changed, would that 76% go down like, if we made more money, does that does that 76 change?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Static on that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Well, your cost of goods is a variable cost. So right now your efficiencies are running at 76%. Um, like like like meaning.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Like meaning what does what does that mean? We&#39;re we&#39;re spending too much. I mean obviously we&#39;re spending too much, but I mean, but</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Where is the repair.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br /> It, it could be that if you made more money, this could slightly come down. But the idea of your cost of goods that this is, this is what it is like. This is how you&#39;re running. This is your efficiency. That&#39;s why I&#39;m, like, addressing this.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Okay.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You know, as the most immediate thing is that if so, right now, it&#39;s let&#39;s call this $500,000 just for ease. Um, right now that you just know, like, every $100 that comes in, 76 of it is going right out to get the garments, to get the to pay for your outside services, to pay for your, um, production people inside to pay for whatever, promo product, whatever you spend your things on to make the end product. That&#39;s all coming out. And then you only have the $24 left to pay yourselves. To pay rent to pay, uh, you know meals, whatever else is, is, you know, just your general overhead and that&#39;s what is like, those are fixed costs as well.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s reliant on, on sales being at a certain level. Correct or like. Like are we right now? Right now we&#39;re not in maintenance mode. We&#39;re in bailing water mode. But while we&#39;re bailing water, we have to have the forward looking to the maintenance to start getting there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not like this can&#39;t be changed or fixed or corrected.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So if you start to, you know, increase your volume or your prices, your selling price, but your production salaries, that&#39;s like a really great place to look at. So like, if your production salaries are fixed, like you, they make the same amount of money, no matter how much they do.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Umhmm, I see.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />See which tends to be the case in a lot of shops, that is going to have a huge impact on your cost of goods. So I do want to add the caveat that while I say like, oh, this cost of goods item isn&#39;t too bad if your team is, like, making the same amount of money whether this number is 473 or this number is 873, then that is something that you need to know. Your, and the revenue in is, is hugely going to affect your cost of goods number with that.

But if a huge driving factor of this is the is the apparel, the cost of goods, the outsourcing for you know, promo products or outsourced service fees and things like that, like if that&#39;s the bulk of the revenue.

And that&#39;s the bulk of where this 76% is coming from, then it&#39;s going to be circular and it&#39;s always going to stay 76%.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p><strong>SM finds it interesting that 1 client could cause the cash issues. JZ wont call out LG's Wife's employer Constellation by name</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So it depends on what is driving this high cost of goods and how we can address it.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s a couple of.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />And that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say is like, where where is this?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s a couple of customers...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Where is this coming from and how do we address it and is it increasing prices. Is it is it like a timing thing, like, did you just buy a ton of inventory and like you just have this warehouse and you&#39;re sitting on tons of garments? Is it a lot of spoilage? Like, that&#39;s one thing that I really want you guys to there&#39;s like a lot of, but just like discounts. That&#39;s why I was doing a bunch of cleanup. In this past month, there&#39;s a lot of, like, discounts and things like that, but that needs to be really intentional. Like, so if you&#39;re having to discount orders, like you&#39;re just giving money away for free if you&#39;re having to you know, if something&#39;s late or if something, you know, the myriad of reasons that there could be discounts on, on invoices to clients, that needs to be that&#39;s one of the things that really needs to be itemized as to where that came from. If things are going out and there&#39;s like spoilage or damage or something, and then it has to be redone.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Umhmm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You know, something to that effect. So like tracking that to see patterns and to see places that you can improve upon.</p><p><strong>JZ goes back and adds expenses to all Printavo orders making true profit per job apparent, finds shocking sales and discounts</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />We started using the expenses in Printavo and one of them  like, you&#39;re able to have them as goods, like there&#39;s a drop down. So now you can have one and just call it loss or whatever. And and every time you will receive, you&#39;ll receive an expense categorized as what it is. And you could put the reason in there and then it it compiles all the ones. And you could look at all your reasons and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So. So.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What is where? Where are you seeing the discounts? Like what is driving that? Because...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I saw a couple that were pretty outrageous. I saw one that discounted it to being I was making negative like -$2,000.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Well, I saw theres a few different... </p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What is that?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />It was a golf one in... hold on.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I&#39;m going to put I&#39;ll put Printavo, but there is a few.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />I was able to clean a bunch of this out, but yeah. So this doesn&#39;t look bad right now, but there was a bunch of discounts that were on here previously that were just closing out quotes and things like that that were reissued for new for a change of scope or like this, this went dead and.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />But...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Doing that, that&#39;s not real. That&#39;s not a real discount. So it affects how the how the numbers were looking. So that&#39;s not something that&#39;s real. But...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That doesn&#39;t have anything to do with discounting the quotes, does it? No that wouldn&#39;t. Would that track into there because we, we store our quotes by, by discounting them to zero don&#39;t we.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right. That&#39;s yeah. That&#39;s a if that&#39;s where that&#39;s where my question was going. If, if you&#39;re seeing a lot of those that&#39;s an issue with. Well yeah. As Joe was saying, the only way for us to basically keep that quote is to zero it out so that ultimately we can still see how everything was quoted. And it doesn&#39;t...</p><p><strong>JZ went and correctly zeroed out all archived quotes and moved original pricing into line descriptions for reuse later. Books now flow correcty.</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got a new thing that we don&#39;t even need that dude. We could just screenshot it and I got a thing that just reads it and recreates it like as a PDF or however we want to see it. Or it could just it scan it into a database and you just look down the line. So I mean, there&#39;s a couple different options now that we don&#39;t need to keep those quotes that way.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, I mean that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m just curious if that&#39;s if you&#39;re seeing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />What whatever they are, I mean, the ones that jump out to me that I have in mind that I wonder if that&#39;s what&#39;s driving some of them are either the previous invoice that like we talked... so Goose Island at the end of 2022 does an invoice for whatever, $40,000 it&#39;s in there and then they know we&#39;re just basically holding the money until the next thing comes into play. So that was an actual invoice that had to be marked as paid. But then it was, you know, whatever it says, 7000 hats or whatever it is, it&#39;s not real. Then the real order comes in that has to be built as a new order in there. And so the original invoice is discounted out for whatever that is, $40,000. And so sorry, I&#39;m explaining it poorly, but.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No, I totally we already discussed this, so I know exactly what that is. But that would be like a different line item. That would be like an accounting adjustment. Because really what you&#39;re doing is, is you&#39;re...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Just crediting?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Deferring the the income there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />They&#39;re using you as like a little bank</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />To or to store their cash. So that&#39;s totally different and that&#39;s perfectly fine. But it does need to be on my end in the accounting, and it needs to be accounted for differently, because if you&#39;re, if we were looking at like, you know, because we want to get into the to the details of like how things are running and like different you know, how&#39;s Q4 compared to Q1? And so Q4 would be like, wow, that looks amazing because you have like a closed...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You know, invoice that doesn&#39;t have costs associated with it. And then in Q1, when you actually make that order for them and you&#39;re buying the materials and you&#39;re paying the people and you&#39;re doing the stuff and you&#39;re like, this is this is free for you, like, we can&#39;t do that in the accounting in the back end, like so.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>LG misappropriation massive driver
</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />However you do do it with your client facing invoicing if you want to call it a discount, like that&#39;s fine. But it&#39;s just an accounting adjustment. It&#39;s like what you can call it, like client facing and Printavo or credit memo would be also usable.

But it for that reason, we do want to keep the money in the right period, which is also like why profit first is going to be amazing. Because what that does is if everything is going into the income account and we are working solely off of the budget provided to allocate to all of these places based on the cash in like that would have told us in Q4, like when you received that, it would be like, oh, you&#39;re running way too good right now. Like, what&#39;s going on? It&#39;s like it gives it bubbles everything to the surface. And then the same for, you know, Q1 so it, it basically doesn&#39;t react to invoices or, or this and that. It&#39;s a, it&#39;s a 100% based on what comes into your bank. And there&#39;s no other way to look at it. It&#39;s just 100% cash based. So like money in, money out, like is it is it working?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Anything we could do to help, which I know we&#39;re all moving towards that. I would love for that to be a reality.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Not I don&#39;t want to get hung up on the discounts, but I do want to if there are there. Because even if there&#39;s something that is like, let&#39;s say that we&#39;re having to get to a point where or it&#39;s it&#39;s price matching something or whatever it is to to take in that order, I, I usually will not show that as a discount on something. So, I mean, I guess just even I just want to I just want to know what is driving those things and if they are there, what, what they actually are which whatever. I mean, if that&#39;s something we can to address too, but I just want to make sure that they&#39;re the, they&#39;re the, they are the right thing. So we&#39;re not looking at it as like here&#39;s a crazy bulk of discounts that are there. But if it&#39;s reading the quotes or something else.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Or what the reason, what the reason for that would have been.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, I can pull, I can run that, like, in the product report and show you, like exactly, I can send that to you in a detailed report.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea, that&#39;s fine you don&#39;t have to do it now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Who I was seeing it on, but I think that I love that, you want to see those details, so I&#39;ll send them to you so we can look at that because I think that that&#39;s really important just to have that, but so basically, if we go. You all stay here.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Um, so if I go back, you know, we&#39;ve talked about, you know, the the cost of goods a little bit high. There&#39;s a few different things that we can, you know, look into to see, you know, how it got to this point. And you know, what we can do about that, but basically the the end game is, is that for this moment, we&#39;re just going to live with what it is.

So we&#39;re in this moment, we&#39;re in this reality, and we want to implement profit first, isolating the the income that comes in to its own account so that what basically what&#39;s going to happen is that, all the every bit of money that comes in, all the revenue that comes in by itself in this income account, and we&#39;re going to start to tweak the allocations such that, like if your cost of goods right now is running at 76%, we&#39;re going to start to like incrementally reduce it so that you have to have less money to spend on cost of goods, like each week, over week over week, where you you just kind of have to like have your wallet slimmed down. So it&#39;s not going to be like a, like a big shock to the system, but it will, like, kind of make you look at your budget, you know, from a cash standpoint, like you kind of have to make it work.

So that&#39;s like the main thing is that this will kind of help you to propel you with that. And then, um, but it&#39;s never going to, like, completely take away like if, if I&#39;m like, ideally I want to see about a 40% cost of goods. I&#39;m not going to start profit first at that rate. So it&#39;s not going to completely disrupt the system. Right? So I just want to make sure that we&#39;re all aware of that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Um, can I ask without you don&#39;t have details, but like, the people that you see that are running at that 40% cost of goods, like, is there a direct correlation where you like, where are they at revenue wise? Where are they at just in terms of, you know, just overall size, like is that are we talking about a facility that has 70 people and they&#39;re doing 8 million in business and they&#39;re close to 40 versus, you know, a similar size operation?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. The smart yeah. The bigger the business the the more uh, when the revenue gets over like, you know, 3 million, 4 million when it gets over that, there&#39;s a lot of equipment, automation, a lot more staff. And it&#39;s like, really streamlined. The, um, cost of goods starts to go way, way down, um, which is kind of fucked up because it&#39;s like.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that&#39;s, that&#39;s our problem with.... and you talk about our, our staffing, you know, in lean times and mean times. What sucks is like the, the team that we have, if everything runs, you know, smooth, we are firing on all four cylinders. You know, you get a little dip and then there&#39;s just backup.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah, 100%.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And, and the team that we have is so perfect for managing where it is right now.

I know, and that that&#39;s the hard part. It&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s the goal is just to keep it so there... everyone is just flowing... and not not dipping below water and then coming way up but I, I&#39;m sorry, I have all sorts of other things. Yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yeah, I think that I mean I think again, just because I know there&#39;s a lot to get into too, but, um, I&#39;ve just from, for me, from a perspective of like, how do we drive that down? I mean, I think there&#39;s from the actual actual tangible things that can be controlled, whether that is just the cost of garments alone.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But there&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />One big one of the big, big problems that I see is just the fact of the monopoly take over of what S&amp;S did.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yes.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And so even if we were able to look at what numbers were from last year and say, like, let&#39;s take out revenue, let&#39;s take out sales, being able to pit the other distributors against each other.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Which I was able to do a lot of the time and say, okay, we can drive it down that way. Yes, there was more volume, but that&#39;s there. And now those conversations are really I have them consistently, probably monthly. But like there&#39;s they don&#39;t need to do shit. I mean they&#39;re, they know that if, if they just set where the price is and say that it&#39;s not going any lower than that. And realistically, as in essence, the only people holding inventory, you can&#39;t go anywhere else, but they&#39;re.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Also holding everyone&#39;s liens on, like holding, you know, everyone&#39;s money. So they, they&#39;re able to force us look at how they&#39;re able, they they never were able to say, we need $50,000 every week. They used to just be, they were happy because they had all small customers. Now they own all debt.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Yea.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />They&#39;re able to just give, give, give, give and then raise the price. And it&#39;s...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />So I think that&#39;s part of it. I mean, yes, I mean, I always have that on radar no matter what, because I have no problem playing that game with them. But I think that the only way if we look at it from just like very black and white pieces of that, the only way to combat that right now is just to say, okay, well, let&#39;s figure out whatever that is in raising prices, but which is fine and thats...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Theres...That&#39;s I&#39;m sorry, are we when when you say cost of goods, it&#39;s not just price of t shirts.</p><p><strong>LG says salaries not on chopping block due to high COG (due to price fixing and misappropriation) but then later suggests its cause of cashflow issues</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />No. Yeah. I&#39;m all of those things in there. But I think short of being able to just, you know, yes. We can&#39;t change, we can&#39;t go across the board right now and say, okay, well we want to lower cost of goods so chop everybody&#39;s salaries, you know, down.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I&#39;m just saying the things that are like the low hanging fruit that immediately I can say, okay, well I don&#39;t know how much wiggle room we&#39;re going to have with just the sheer cost of goods of of garments and things, because of, because of that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But I think our choices we&#39;re making with certain customers is, is, is is what&#39;s pushing it. Because as, as we go to these the people that need all the agency stuff. A lot of it does become pass through stuff that is, you know, pins and stickers and this and that. That takes months to make that we have to pay half up front. And then when it comes back months later, it&#39;s just fractions of, you know, of profit, which I get. I understand that, you know, when someone is used to going to, you know, brand addition, they expect this at that price. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s like Amazon. So I mean, I get it, but maybe we try to steer away from these customers that need all this really expensive stuff.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I mean, I think there&#39;s something in there, but I mean, all of the just to the overseas stuff, we&#39;re not we don&#39;t, that&#39;s paid after the fact.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s after?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />The only people. Yeah. It&#39;s all it&#39;s all after the fact. I mean, so the, the payments that are coming out of there is and they&#39;re, they&#39;re being very cool right now with not having payment for quite a lot of things that we just keep putting off basically. But but yeah, there&#39;s, I mean there&#39;s a combination of of all of the things in there. I think that there&#39;s I mean, we&#39;ve got probably three people that are net firms clients. And yeah, I would prefer to never deal with a net firm client for the rest of my life. But yeah.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And that...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Also.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That&#39;s my same exact thought. That&#39;s my, my, my thought is break, break, take away their power and take you know, small little jobs from the little man. That&#39;s where, we love small, you know, easy setup. Flip them in and out. That, I love doing hard stuff, too, but there&#39;s there&#39;s people with their money standing and they don&#39;t know where to go. You know what I mean? So they&#39;re going to get that stuff done. If we could just even capture any of that. A lot of these conversations go away. Well, don&#39;t go away, don&#39;t become the thing that&#39;s on fire right now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Right.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Yeah. So I mean, there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot of different components to this and a lot of things to look at, but definitely what, you know, I, I want to, you know, get, get the cash allocations completed as soon as possible. So, if you guys aren&#39;t able to isolate the income account and, like, move that over, I can I can go in and manually take all of the deposits, push them into like an income account that&#39;s isolated and then do the allocations, like I can like reverse engineer that, that action so that we can start to see that effect.

Because basically it&#39;s going to start to you know, be that living budget where we&#39;re doing, you know, the, the targeted allocations to, to your costs and, you know, like how much you should be spending in cost of goods, you&#39;ll know how much you have to spend for your payroll, for your overhead, which is going to be, you know, your rent, your marketing, everything. Basically that&#39;s it.Owners pay, uh, which is like your salary owners pay.

And then your profit distributions. So this is really important because in leaner times, we can&#39;t be afraid to let things fall off and be, like, nostalgic for kind of how it was or what we&#39;re comfortable with or what&#39;s established because it&#39;s like you know, an ebb and flow. Like typically if you&#39;re able to be more flexible, it will.

It&#39;s like the tide or whatever. It&#39;ll come back like it comes in and out. But you do have to be flexible to let things fall off. And that&#39;s what this is going to show us. So basically like if we, if we run like the, the profit first reports now and we, Profit First would dictate that you use your real revenue, which is after cost of goods.

And we would combine your, your salary, wages plus distributions, things like that. That would put, where is that? Your owners pay combined for both of your shareholders would be at would be running at 70% of your real revenue right now, um, for 2023. And that&#39;s unsustainable for the business.</p><p><strong>JZ confirms SM is not talking about salary cuts, actually suggested salaries and payroll is good</strong></p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />But you&#39;re not saying we should cut our salaries. You should say we should do more sales to cover our salaries.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No, not right now. I&#39;m saying you need to.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Oh, interesting.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You have to. You&#39;re in this. You&#39;re living this right now. So you have to let the cash that comes in dictate how you spend out</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Who determines the amount, and when we could get paid,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />It&#39;s a percentage. So it would be based on like what is...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Because I mean I&#39;m getting paid zero now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Huh?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />So I mean I don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t know how I could do any better than that.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So if you have, um. If we&#39;re targeting, let&#39;s say 60% cost of goods...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Umhmm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />We take all of the money that comes in that week, every dollar that walks in the door and we take 60% of that, put it towards cost of goods. That&#39;s how you&#39;re operating right now. You need 60% of that to pay your production team, your vendors.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I 100% understand that. But what seems to happen is that becomes the new... we just lower the bar is what I&#39;m saying. And it never comes back because there&#39;s no reason for it to. That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No, no. That&#39;s not so. That&#39;s totally not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />No, no, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not talking about you. I&#39;m saying this is a situation that unfolds. So a, I have court appointed fees that I have to pay for my divorce and my, my maintenance, and we just got to get more sales. It can&#39;t be, Joe will pay for it and because there&#39;s no other sales people to go do anything else because Joe&#39;s stuck in production world.

I just would like you to be very clear about this being a maintenance thing, and not the new norm for this to become &quot;Hey, you know what? You guys do great when you don&#39;t pay each other, because that, I won&#39;t be able to sit there with the keys if I if I can&#39;t...

And this has is not a lifestyle change or anything. I am already making about half of what we made the year before, and, and I have you know, responsibilities and when there&#39;s, the throughput is pinched, it could be used for a controlling reason.

So I would just like to be clear that I am not on board with the just forever Joe doesn&#39;t get paid anymore until we figure this out, because there is, there will be zero reason to figure it out.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />No. So I just want to show you. So basically like there the whole like it&#39;s in the name Profit First we want to pay the owner and reward the owner.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I get that I&#39;m just making sure the, the entire, what you&#39;re trying to do comes across as what it&#39;s supposed to be, is what I&#39;m saying.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />100%. So but it had. So basically, you have to be proactive, kind of towards where you&#39;re, where you&#39;re at with the cash flow and I&#39;m not saying like, we like let&#39;s, let&#39;s be cool with 75% cost of goods and like, let&#39;s run at that efficiency level and let&#39;s just do that. So that&#39;s why the whole first top of the meeting was like, let&#39;s get.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />What if it&#39;s one specific customer?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Hmm?</p><p><strong>JZ sparks interest when mentioning "one customer" causing cash flow issues.

I&#39;m sorry. We&#39;ll figure it all out in the end, sales goals, I guess don&#39;t... are, aren&#39;t a thing for us. It&#39;s it&#39;s just we&#39;ll figure it out on...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />You have sales those goals</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Then what are they?

Because the ones that I have are, aren&#39;t, are like 30 a week, 20, 30 a week. Um, you know, then there&#39;s some that spike super high because we luck out with like Riot Fest or something really high priced. That took months to get done. And it looks like we had some gigantic success.

I just would like to make clear that they&#39;re supposed to be sales goals. And what what is that number? And and how does that affect, the, the Profit First thing like can that be used to, to can, can that be exploited by, by saying, well, we didn&#39;t make anything, so we&#39;re just taking it all out of this until there&#39;s nothing left?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Taking it out of what?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Out of like, so if we were to say our salaries are too high, what, what level do we decide that they go back?

I know you didn&#39;t.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Ok.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I&#39;m just. I&#39;m just trying to get out into the air a true acknowledgement of what that really means.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Um.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>JZ looks for ground rules to be set</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />And where is the, where, where do we hit again that it becomes normal. Is this a forever thing? And yes, I know it&#39;s not. I&#39;m just saying. Please lay out some ground rules. I&#39;m on board. But please lay out the ground rules that that everyone has to play by.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Right. Let me just. Show you a side by side, okay? So that we can see what I&#39;m trying to illustrate here. Uh, I think this would be helpful. So right now. Um, this is what. So let&#39;s say your sales goal is you can see my screen, right?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Umhmm.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />So your sales goal, let&#39;s say it&#39;s 100,000. You make it. We&#39;re targeting 65%, which is a decrease of 75%. So we&#39;re already like, you know, running a little bit leaner from the actual percentages right now. So this is, this is what your business&#39;s revenue and how you&#39;re operating right now dictates that, that you should take as a healthy business like this is what you should set aside. And it includes profit. It includes reserves for in this illustration, it includes tax savings. But if you&#39;re not having profit, you don&#39;t need to reserve for taxes. So that would be a set aside for debt reduction things like that. So this is profit is for for the shareholders. Owners pay is for the shareholders. This would be, you know, cost of goods, debt reduction, etc, until you&#39;re actually, having a profitable moment in which there you&#39;re owing taxes on that, and then the rest is for operating, which is payroll, everything like that. So this is how these numbers shake out right now in the percentages that you&#39;re living in, with the with the revenue that&#39;s coming in.

So if your cost of goods goes down to like 50% and you do hit the 20,000. Your owners pay for it, so this is the same. Let&#39;s call this, the end of May, you know, we&#39;ve reduced, we&#39;ve made some changes. We&#39;ve reduced your, you&#39;re having a profit of $10,000 split between the two shareholders in addition to having your owners pay. It&#39;s the same percentage. The money is much larger because the efficiencies are being run and things like that, so you know, we&#39;re trying to be mindful of where money should go based on how much money there is, instead of taking money that&#39;s not there and putting it to places, because that&#39;s what you&#39;re used to doing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well so we&#39;re used to the money being there while we&#39;re taking it. So the I said, we&#39;re used to the money being there while we&#39;re taking it. And you know, we have we have obligations.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>Stephanie Morin Spark: </strong><br />Ok.</p><h2 style='font-size:14px;color:#3E3E3B;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;'>JZ calls out how new system will reward LG by starving JZ</h2><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Yeah. And when when there&#39;s no obligation to try to meet any goals, it just becomes who&#39;s standing in the shop to, to, to facilitate whatever, but in the end, I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not going to take this over, all I hear is I got to do sales.

And, you know, anything else that I can just kind of assist with? While we&#39;re working on implementation of Profit First and things like that. So, you know, just let me know, what I can do if you have any questions on, you know, the financials, make sure you guys have everything. But I&#39;ll wait to, you know, I think it would be best to get this underway.

I have the recordings of of that phone call that he&#39;d like to bring up to you. It&#39;s a masterclass in customer service, actually. But there are no problems. 

I&#39;m here holding it down in Chicago the way I always am. But now I&#39;m being starved on purpose. And you shouldn&#39;t ask those things that you ask for before you starve me on video, Lucas. So all I&#39;m saying is, when are you going to comply with the law?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If you continue to threaten me...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Are you to are you going to comply with the law?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />If you continue to threaten me,</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />There&#39;s zero threats.

And you can do your due diligence. And you can have your own outside counsel. They&#39;ve tried to contact you a hand full of times now.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />That I don&#39;t. Do you think that I don&#39;t?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Ok, have them contact...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />You think that for the last couple of months I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m watching... Lucas I&#39;m giving you every chance in the world.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />I don&#39;t I don&#39;t need a chance. You you are seemingly oblivious to all of the other larger, larger issues.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Such as? Such as?</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Well, one this behavior, but beyond...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Asking you to give me my legally.... that&#39;s the crazy part. Do you want to know what the belligerent, belligerent behavior is? I asked five times over the last two months if we were going to get a bank account together. That&#39;s my belligerent.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />And we&#39;re not.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />I got it in writing.</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>LG: </strong><br />Okay, so that&#39;s fine.

I&#39;m not required to do anything. It just becomes...</p><p style="font-size: 14px;color: #3E3E3B;text-decoration: none;"><strong>JZ: </strong><br />Well there&#39;s the law.
